            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis Argument for the Biſhops Right of judging in Capital Cauſes in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, for their being one of the three States of the Realm, and that their Right is unalterable by Law, was written above two years ſince, and prepared for the Preſs, time enough to be made publick againſt an expected Seſſion of Parliament, in <hi>October</hi> 1679. But the Parliament being prorogued from that time until <hi>January,</hi> the Author was willing to reſpite the Publication to adviſe with his ſecond thoughts, and again to review what he had written in a caſe of this weight and moment; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that he had but a ſhort time allowed him for its compoſure. Since that there has been publiſhed by an excellent perſon, a Book in vindication of their Right of judging, called <hi>The Grand Queſtion,</hi> ſufficient to give ſatisfaction, if the world were juſt and impartial, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make right Judgment in the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>It may well be reaſonably expected that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People ſhould not be only juſt, but favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:56755:3"/> to any pretence of a Chriſtian Biſhop to any ſecular truſt that does not leſſen the dignity of the Office, and ſeems unworthy of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; which as it exempts him from mean and ſordid offices and affairs, of an inferior and more private concernment, ſo it commends him to the Government of matters of a more publick and univerſal influence, ſuch as require the moſt improved wiſdom and learning, and a noble virtue.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me moſt unreaſonable that thoſe that are the great and principal Expounders of the Chriſtian Law, which gives Law to all Laws, and inſtructs men to diſcharge their ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices both publick and private; that thoſe who are the great Guides of our Conſciences, and by whoſe Directions and Inſtitutions we form our Judgments in the greateſt intricacies and doubts that perplex humane affairs; that the Guides of a Religion which is formed all to life and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for the making Governments equal, and private men good and obedient, which is little elſe but an Obligation to Juſtice and Charity, and principally purſues that which is the end, deſign, and whole buſineſs of Government: I ſay, it ſeems to me moſt abſurd and incongruous, that this Order of men at any time ought to be ſhut out of that Council and Court, where Laws are made, and Rules given, for the Government of a Chriſtian Common-wealth, where the moſt difficult and intricate cauſes are to be heard and
<pb facs="tcp:56755:3"/> determined, and where an unlimited power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of cenſuring the Actions of the greateſt men, and the adminiſtration of publick affairs, and the ſafety of the Nation are conſulted, which cannot be long preſerved but by purſuing the dictates of a wiſe Religion: Such is the Chriſtian Religion, if any other; we ſhould diſhonour it by comparing it to the beſt.</p>
            <p>Paganiſm became deſpicable and abandoned ſoon after its publication: Yet <hi>Tully</hi> in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>ad Pontifices,</hi> magnifies the wiſdom of the <hi>Romans</hi> as Divine, in advancing the <hi>Pagan</hi> Prieſts to the higheſt places in their Common-wealth, by which the Common-wealth he ſaith was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. <hi>Cum multa Divinitùs, Pontifices, à Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus noſtris inventa atque inſtituta ſunt, tum nihil praeclarius, quam quod vos eoſdem &amp; Religionibus Deorum immortalium &amp; ſummae Reipublicae praeeſſe voluerunt: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ampliſſimi &amp; clariſſimi Cives Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicam bene gerendo, Religiones ſapientèr interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tando Rempublicam conſervarent.</hi> Such an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more duly and with better reaſon our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors conceived of the advantage that might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the Nation by advancing the Prelates of the Church into the Civil Government. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they have made them neceſſary to it, and framed the Government in a ſort to depend upon them, and left it ſcarce able to maintain it ſelf without them in its preſent conſtitution. The Temporal Barons will ſoon find themſelves una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintain their own dignity, and to ſuſtain
<pb facs="tcp:56755:4"/> that province that is allotted to them in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, unaſſiſted with the Intereſt and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Prelates, the Spiritual Barons, a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power if they be, as they ought to be, of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſteem with the people.</p>
            <p>If the preſent Biſhops are not all ſo happy as to poſſeſs ſuch an eſteem, we know what cauſe to aſſign for the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the unhappy Schiſm that hath too long continued in our Church, hath for its own Juſtification, after they are almoſt ſham'd out of the ſcruples which firſt cauſed the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſought occaſions againſt the Perſons of the Biſhops, and rather than they will want faults to complain of, the Order it ſelf muſt be loaded with all the faults of all the Biſhops in all Countries and Ages, and they adventure now to diſparage their perſons for the ſake of their office. But ſure it is a folly that can fall upon no people, but ſuch who by the evils they feel or fear, are vext out of their underſtanding, to ſuppreſs any Office that is neceſſary to any Common-wealth in any form of Government, for the faults of the Officers for the time being: But too true it is, that a form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment while eſtabliſhed, may be ſo utterly miſunderſtood by the moſt, when it is not, or not duly adminiſtred, that a true and exact deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of it, and a diſcourſe of the Offices and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the ſeveral parts of the Government would be taken by them for ſome <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, or no better pleaſe them than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the ſtrength of an impregnable Fort,
<pb facs="tcp:56755:4"/> once the Security of the Nation when inveſted by the Enemy. A Lecture of a learned Phyſician of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſus Partium</hi> will not give ſight to a blind Eye, nor motion to a withered hand; and no body is warmed or comforted by a painted fire: But God be thanked we are not yet deſtitute of the benefits of a good Government.</p>
            <p>Another cauſe I apprehend may much leſſen the Biſhops in the eſteem of the People, and make them want that Reputation that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to every Governour in proportion to his Charge, is their manner of promotion. The Miniſters of State, whoſe buſineſs it ought to be to underſtand the true Characters of men that are preferred to that Office, are often miſtaken; however in this Courſe they ſeem not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted for their own Merit, but at the pleaſure of the great Courtiers, and at beſt the Miniſters of State can do no more than recommend to the King for that office the beſt of thoſe they know, which are many times moſt unfit.</p>
            <p>But this may be remedied when his Majeſty ſhall pleaſe to give leave to the Clergy of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſs to chooſe their own Dioceſan, their Choice notwithſtanding ſubmitted to the Kings appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Confirmation (which was permitted by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperor, and was in uſe in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the beſt Ages of the Church) or by ſome other method which may be adviſed by his great Council, whereby the greateſt aſſurance may be given that the beſt and fitteſt perſons be preferred
<pb facs="tcp:56755:5"/> to Biſhopricks: for the Common people are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and ſuſpicious, and what ever may be done by bad means they always think is ſo. But if Biſhops were promoted to their Sees with the gratulations and applauſes of the whole body of the Clergy of the reſpective Dioceſſes, all that paſſeth under their advice and conſent would likely meet with the general ſatisfactions of the people, as it would well deſerve, as long as the Clergy can have any Authority with them; That is, as long as the Nation continues Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But the general Corruption of Manners and decay of Piety is the great and trueſt cauſe why the Biſhops unenvied enjoy no part of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that our Anceſtors Wiſdome and Piety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon their order conformably to all other the Ancient Chriſtian Governments. But when Virtue and Piety ſhall recover their eſteem, the reverence of the Clergy will return. We are not like long to expect this happy Change, for Vice is now arrived to a <hi>Plethora,</hi> and like to burſt by its own exceſſes: And we well hope that the miſchiefs which we ſuffer will cure that evil from whence they ſpring, and prevent the greater Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities that it further threatens. However it becomes all good men to aſſiſt, to ſupport the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, which is the cheapeſt, the ſureſt and the next way to arrive at a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of things. This was the deſign of the Author of the Grand Queſtion. After the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb facs="tcp:56755:5"/> of that Book I laid by all thoughts of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this Treatiſe: But perceiving that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what he hath ſaid, the Right yet remains controverted, and a Book is ſince printed, wherein ſeveral things are objected in prejudice of this Right, and more is expected: I did review theſe Papers, wherein I found I had prevented thoſe objections, and with a little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication they would appear inſignificant. I did reſolve to make this publick. And beſides that I apprehended ſome things material to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were omitted by the Grand Queſtion; that a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral way of ſpeaking things to the ſame purpoſe hath its advantage. Our great Courts affect to have ſeveral arguments on the ſame ſide in great Cauſes, and our Reporters publiſh them. Beſides herein ſeveral things are occaſionally diſcourſt of, which makes it of further uſefulneſs to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Our adverſaries alſo were treated too kindly by him and had deſerved ſharper reflections than he makes upon them for their falſe and perverſe Reaſonings, and ought to loſe that reputation which they abuſe to the hurt of the Government. And further, I thought it not for the honour of our faculty that never fails to ſupply the worſt cauſe with Advocates, That a queſtion of this Nature, wherein both Church and State, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and our Civil Policy is concerned, and the Right thereof not only clear and evident in it ſelf but alſo uſeful to the State, ſhould have not one of the Robe to plead for it. The friends of the
<pb facs="tcp:56755:6"/> Cauſe will not grudge to read two Books for the Right as well as ſeveral againſt it, and the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of our Cauſe ought to ſuffer the like trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves which they occaſion to others.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations did induce me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this Treatiſe. I am well pleaſed that I am ingaged in a good Cauſe that was ſuited to one of my ſlender Abilities. Right is ſo ſtrong an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for it ſelf, that it wants only light to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it: Whereas an unrighteous cauſe ſtands in need of diſguiſings and ſhadowings, and all the Artifices and fetches of the Wit of abler men, to give that a Colour at leaſt which is deſtitute of Law and Right.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this queſtion the Conſtitution of the Government is concerned, and the Right of a moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal conſtituent part, and that in a matter of the higheſt Truſt, which if truly a Right, can be no more relinquiſhed (as the Nature of this Right is) than a truſt can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, a duty and a Right denyed to be paid and performed, or the Conſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment changed.</p>
               <p>For of ſuch a Nature doth appear to be the Right in pretence and Controverſy, of the Lords
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56755:10"/> the Biſhops to have judgment in the Houſe of Lords in Capital Cauſes.</p>
               <p>For by their being made Barons, they owed their judgments in ſuch Cauſes as a ſervice to the King, at firſt by their Tenures in Baronage (for though ſince they are become <hi>Barones Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptitii,</hi> or Barons by Writ, their duty is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.) And beſides, the Cogniſance of ſuch Cauſes become their own Right, being a part of and belonging to the dignity and office of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. And it likewiſe became an appointment in the Government, in which the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity have their Intereſt (for that is principally provided for and procured in all Governments) whoſe greateſt concern it is to have Juſtice done againſt all Criminals; and to have great and wiſe, juſt and good men in the Adminiſtrations of Juſtice, and other great offices of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>England</hi> did anciently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the benefit of this Conſtitution, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Baronage of <hi>England,</hi> the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, could reſiſt the Torrent of Arbitrary Government. And it may be eaſily underſtood too, that nothing but the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of <hi>England</hi> is able to ſupport the Throne: For that Monarchy unleſs ſo ſupported, is the weakeſt and moſt precarious and dependent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the World except it be ſupported with an Army, and turned into a Tyranny. That the Throne ſhould be eſtabliſhed by Natural and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56755:10"/> gentle proviſions, and the Government fixed is every mans greateſt intereſt.</p>
               <p>If the Lords Temporal have more under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and a larger <hi>Poteſtas jubendi;</hi> yet the Lords Spiritual out-did them <hi>Authoritate ſuadendi,</hi> and had more voluntary obedience. The Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual have ſeveral Advantages as they are <hi>Novi homines,</hi> men choſen out of Thouſands for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Character and Spirit, and need not want any accompliſhments, if duely choſen and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, for the diſcharge of the greateſt Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are to be managed by wiſdome and integrity; and therefore they cannot be well wanted in any Miniſtries in the Government, to which they are beſpoken, and have a legal deſignation.</p>
               <p>Since this Authority by the very opening of the Cauſe doth appear probably belonging to the Biſhops, and if ſo that it cannot, without breach of their duty that they owe to all the parts of the Government and the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, depart from it; it may ſurely be inſiſted upon, diſputed and maintained by them without blame or imputation. But ſo unhappily it falls out, that the very diſputing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of this Matter by reaſon of the unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of the diſpute, and the delays that were thereby given to the moſt important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Nation, to the great hazard as ſome think of the ſumm of Affairs, was very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to the publick. And now both parties
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56755:11"/> are charging one another with all the miſchiefs and the delays, that this Controverſy hath given to publick proceeding, or can with any probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be thought to have occaſioned. And there are not men wanting, on either ſide within doors and without, that are forward enough to charge all thoſe miſchiefs as deſerved by their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite party, which may eventually happen hereupon.</p>
               <p>Who ſees not how fatal this Controverſy is like to prove to one or other of the Litigants, and to the Government in conſequence, if this Cauſe cannot be duely heard and conſidered, and be determined upon its own Merits, without undue Cenſures and Reflections on either ſide: Since at laſt the contenders themſelves muſt be the Judges, and give judgment in the Cauſe, or it can never be quieted and have an end. I am ſure, paſſion is no equal Judge and Arbiter, and men angred and provoked have not the ſame ſentiments of the ſame things, as when calm and ſerene. And becauſe there is no common Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it ought to be conſidered by both parties with all equality of judgment and an exact pondering and weighing of the reaſons offered on either ſide; for that otherwiſe it can never be fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, but muſt for ever remain a Controverſy to the immediate overthrow and deſtruction of the Government, or over-ruled by the force and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a moſt dangerous conſequence in the courſe of time, to the Government, and will be a laying
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56755:11"/> of the Axe to the very root of the Tree, and will put the Government it ſelf into a State of War, between the ſeveral conſtituent parts of it, and given an occaſion for one part to uſurp upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until the tone and frame of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment become changed, and at laſt fall into ruine.</p>
               <p>I am very well aware of the gravity of the Queſtion and its importance, the high honour and regard that is due to the Houſe of Commons in Parliament, what commendations are due to them in their perſons, for their zeal and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all means if it be poſſible, to ſave the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Religion and Government: And what a great Capacity, that Houſe in its very conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the firſt deſignation of the Government, and by their mighty growth in power and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Courſe of time, have in procuring the publick good, and that they cannot have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt divided from the common Weal. I muſt do them right, and with the greateſt clearneſs and ſatisfaction, I determine with my ſelf, that their zeal for public Juſtice againſt unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offences in their judgment, and a prejudicate opinion they had conceived of the Spiritual Lords unindifferency (how duely will appear by and by) gave the firſt occaſion to this Queſtion, which was the true <hi>cauſa ſuaſoria</hi> of their denyal to the Biſhops a Right of Succeſſion and judgment in that noble queſtion, Whether a Treaſon of State can be pardoned? And that put them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56755:12"/> upon the ſearch of Precedents, an Oracle that will alwayes give a <hi>Reſponſe</hi> agreeable to the Enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and Conſulter. For I am ſure there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo abſurd and irregular, that rude Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and the miſcarriages in humane Affairs, in length of time will not furniſh a Precedent for. And theſe Precedents ſuch as they were reported (which we are hereafter to conſider) by their diligent Members, became a <hi>cauſa juſtifica,</hi> and the matter in pretence to warrant their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that a great reaſon of State did ſeem to them to require.</p>
               <p>And now whether the Lords Spiritual can be Judges in Capital Cauſes in Parliament is become a Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Though the Biſhops Right to judge in capital Cauſes in Parliament, ſeem to be clear and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially demonſtrated from what is viſible and obvious, to the moſt vulgar obſervation of the conſtitution of the Government; every body knows how the Lords Spiritual and Lords Temporal are placed in the ſtile of Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and in the Heralds order in the Houſe of Lords.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Biſhops give firſt their Votes, even before Dukes; The Suffragan Dioceſans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Viſcounts, and before the Barons: And in the ſame order did the Biſhops ſtand in the publick Cenſus in the times of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as may be ſeen in Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> his Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the word <hi>Alderman.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56755:12"/>
               <p>The great Authority, Power and Rule, that was intended the Prelates ſhould have in all the great concernments of the Kingdom, that were to make the buſineſs of the Houſe of Lords, may be beſt underſtood from the high place that hath been alwayes alotted to their Order in that Houſe; for Publick and civil honours are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes appointed and adjuſted to the dignity of the Miniſters, offices, and Services, that are to be performed to the Government. Such a ſoleciſm was never enacted by an Order of State, That thoſe perſons that were leſs in power, and under abatement and reſtraint of Authority, ſhould be preferred to thoſe in place, that had plenary power in the ſame Courts. It is well known too, That the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was originally honoured with the firſt Writ of Summons to Parliament. Since the Conqueſt there never was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhop, that had not his ſeveral Writ of Summons to Parliament; Though the number of Temporal Barons have been reduced, and many of the Regular Barons diſmiſt of that honour: for that their office was nothing in the Church, and nothing but the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of the Abbots, preferred them to that State. Nothing ſeems too big or too high for ſo great and publick a character of the Biſhops, or out of the intendment of their truſt that can ever be the buſineſs of a Parliament. The greater the matters are that are agitated there, the more neceſſary is the aſſiſtance of the Biſhops; for he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56755:13"/> that in any affair is moſt truſted, is to be moſt concerned, and by how much the affairs are of greateſt moment, in the ſame proportion they are more ſtrictly obliged and required to aſſiſt in the management thereof.</p>
               <p>We all know what ſort of criminal proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thoſe are, that are made in Parliament, and what great conſideration they are of, that they are alwayes the ſymptoms of a very ſickly State, and the reſults of very great diſorders in the Common-Wealth. In theſe Caſes, if in any, the Lords Spiritual cannot be wanted: The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to interpoſe in any one ſingle proſecution that is Parliamentary, hath proved the occaſion, That their Right of Seſſion is now brought into Queſtion. For to ſpeak the truth, it is not very conſiſtent with the Reverence that is naturally due to the Prelates, to think that a Truſt and Authority of ſo high a nature, ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, and they ſhould at any time find reaſons to neglect it. But for what omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they have been guilty of (though upon a general conſideration without examining the particular Cauſes and Reaſons, men not friendly to their Order, may thus cenſure them) we ſhall make a fair Apology as we ſhall meet with them, and as they fall in to be conſidered in this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>We are now to give you ſome account, how this comes now to be a queſtion, for the very queſtioning thereof makes ſome prejudice againſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56755:13"/> the Right; and there is ſcarce any thing ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and true in Nature, but if once put under diſpute, that can recover again into a general cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and aſſurance.</p>
               <p>It hath ſcarce eſcaped any mans obſervation, that hath been acquainted with the buſineſs of the Courts of Law, That the greatneſs of the pretender, and the value of the Intereſt and Right in pretence, doth cauſe a point of Law to be contended, which would never elſe have been ſtirred, eſpecially if the Right be invidiouſly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by another. Beſides theſe three conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, which are foreign to the true Right, I proteſt there is nothing to my apprehenſion of any moment offered in Print to continue it a Queſtion.</p>
               <p>I find Two Books Printed upon this Queſtion, both of them tending to diſgrace the Biſhops Right of judging in capital Cauſes in Parliament. One in <hi>Octavo,</hi> called <hi>A Letter of a Gentleman to his Friend, ſhewing the Biſhops are not to be Judges in Parliament, in Caſes Capital.</hi> He begins with a Preface containing ſome matters and reaſons againſt Biſhops intermedling at all in ſecular affairs; and after that he tells us, That the Law of Parliament is beſt declared by uſage, gives us ſeveral precedents, wherein he ſuppoſes the Biſhops abſent; and concludes they were ſo for want of Right and Authority to be there. And to give ſome Authority to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of omiſſion (as he would have them)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56755:14"/> He tells us of the Aſſize of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> an Act of Parliament made 10 <hi>Hen.</hi> 2 that excluded the Biſhops in ſuch Cauſes; and of a Proteſtation made by all the Biſhops in the 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they renounce all Judgement of Right in ſuch Cauſes, upon the obligation they were under to the Canon Law: and to render it impoſſible, they ſhould have any ſuch Right, and to make them incompetent Judges, he adventures to ſay and prove after his manner, That the Biſhops are not Peers; and to prepare the way for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of that Houſe, he adventures to broach an opinion, That the Biſhops <hi>are not one of the three States, nor an eſſential part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another Book in <hi>Folio,</hi> called <hi>A diſcourſe of the Peerage and Juriſdiction of the Lords Spiritual in Parliament.</hi> This Author pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the ſame deſign, upon the ſame grounds, with ſome peculiar reaſonings of his own. If therein I give him ſatisfaction in what he hath peculiar, without mentioning diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them, I am ſure he will thank me for it.</p>
               <p>But we will conſider the <hi>Octavo</hi>'s Preface, examine his Precedents, and ſhew that they are either not againſt us, or for us. And all along obſerve the candor and integrity of the Author. We ſhall further ſhew how abſurd his Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are to make thoſe Precedents to conclude any thing for his purpoſe. We will alſo with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56755:14"/> the cleareſt demonſtration prove, That the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize of <hi>Clarendon</hi> eſtabliſheth the Biſhops Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and right to judge in capital Cauſes in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: And likewiſe, that the proteſtation made by the Biſhops 11. <hi>R.</hi> 2. is a moſt ſolemn Recognition of their Right; that the Biſhops have ſate in Judgment in the greateſt capital Cauſes in Parliament that ever happened; that this their Authority hath been exerciſed in their own Perſons, and by their Proxies, and recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by Parliaments, and other great Courts of Judicature; but never before this time brought into Queſtion: That no Canon could leſſen the Right, at moſt it is but a Councel for their guidance in the exerciſe of their Authority, which they might obſerve as they pleaſe: That the Popes Canon Law was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received into <hi>England,</hi> that prohibits Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to judge in capital Cauſes: That the Biſhops have declined to aſſiſt in pronounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sentence of death, ſometimes as unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for their Order; but notwithſtanding, and without being contrary to the example and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of their Predeceſſors, the Biſhops may judge upon the Plea of the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Pardon. For that if they do judge the Pardon not good, the Earl is not therefore to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And for the better clearing the Biſhops Right, and for the eſtabliſhing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhall prove that the Spiritual Lords are Peers of the Realm, and one of the three States,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56755:15"/> and an eſſential part of the Government, which no legal power can charge or alter. Laſtly, we ſhall repel the calumnies of the Adverſaries in this cauſe, by which they indeavour to render the Prelates unworthy of their Right, and to put them amongſt the <hi>prodigi &amp; furioſi,</hi> that are ſcarce allowed to be Proprietors of their own. And conclude our Diſcourſe with a juſt Apology for the Lords the Biſhops.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>ANd Firſt I begin with the <hi>Octavo,</hi> which in the Introduction to his Precedents ſaith, That he will not meddle with the General Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, How far forth Clergy-men in Orders are forbidden having any thing to do with ſecular matters, nor what in that particular the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law requires, as that Reſcript of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Honorous</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> which Enacts that Clergy-men ſhall have no communion with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Functions, or things appertaining to the Court; or the Decree of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> That Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould not take upon them ſo much as the Overſight of an Orphan, nor the proving of Wills: ſaying, It was a filthy thing crept in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, which appertained to the Maſter of his Revenue. Nor what our common Law of <hi>England</hi> ſeems to allow or diſallow, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56755:15"/> a ſpecial Writ in the Regiſter upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Maſter of an Hoſpital, being it ſeems a Clergy-man, and choſen an Officer in a Mannor, to which that Hoſpital did belong, ſaying it was, <hi>Contra Legem &amp; conſuetudinem Regni, &amp; non conſonum;</hi> It was contrary to the Law and Cuſtom of the Kingdom, and not agreeable to reaſon, That he who had cure of Souls, and ſhould ſpend his time in Prayer, and Church du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhould be made to attend upon Secular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. I meddle not neither ſaith he, with what ſeems to be the Divine Law, as having been the practice of the Apoſtles, and by them declared to be grounded upon reaſon, and to be what in reaſon ought to be; which was this, That they ſhould not leave the word of God and ſerve Tables, though that was a Church Office; and yet they ſay it is not reaſon we ſhould do that, for their work was the Miniſtry of the Word and Prayer, much leſs then were they to be employed in ſecular affairs. This with great skill he prefixes to his precedents (which make the Law of Parliament, which is the Law of the Land he ſaith) and after he had ſaid all that he could to make the very pretence it ſelf unlawful, and to perſwade the ſhutting of the Biſhops out of the Houſe, for altogether, he ſubjoyns his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents: he thought certainly that when he had placed the Precedents in ſuch a light, they muſt look all of that colour, and have that appearance, which he indeavours too by other arts to give them.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56755:16"/>
               <p>But we ſhall ſpoil his deſign in a very few words, which the obſervant Reader will appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how pertinent it is, and ſatisfactory to what is objected in the recited Preface, though we do not for brevity ſake apply our anſwer to every particular of his Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>We ſay therefore we can't think the Clergy fit for Proctors, Publick Notaries and Scriveners, or Uſhers of Court, or other ſubſervient offices; nor fit to make Conſtables, Tythingmen, and Scavengers; nor to keep watch and ward, and to be a Hayward or Bayliff of his Worſhips Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Townſhips: Or that they ſhould be Merchants or Farmers, or interpoſe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any Secular affairs for gain: That it was declined by the Paſtors and Teachers of the Church, as an indignity for them to adminiſter to Tables, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Proviſions of Charity in their Church-feaſt, and they ought to keep far off from a ſuſpition of filthy Lucre; nay, not to preach principally for gain, or make a gain of Godlineſs: By the Imperial Law accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, they were diſcharged from the trouble of being Tutors and Curators of Orphans; nay, where the Law had deſigned them that care by their relation to the Orphans, out of reſpect to their dignity they were diſcharged by the Law, that they might not incur unkindneſs to the neglect of their relations, nor yet be incumbred with ſuch private attendances to divert them from their great Cure. Though the Presbytery
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56755:16"/> might be admitted <hi>ad Tutelam Legitimam</hi> by their own conſent, and this was made Law by <hi>Juſtinian, Cod. L.</hi> 1. By which Law it appears not a Judgment of Incompetency in Clergy-men, to intermedle in Secular affairs; but an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exemption of the Biſhops from ſuch private concernments, was the reaſon of that Law.</p>
               <p>It was further provided by a Law of <hi>Juſtinian, Cod. L.</hi> 1. That Prieſts ſhould not be made of Court-Officers, but thoſe that were ſo made might continue, the reaſon of the Law is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it; becauſe that ſuch a man was <hi>Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritus in Executionibus vehementibus ſeu aſperis &amp; his quae ex ea re accidunt peccatis. Non utique aequum fuerit modo quidem &amp; illico eſſe Taxeatam &amp; Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leatam &amp; facere omnium acerbiſſima; mox autem Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotem ordinari, &amp; humanitate &amp; innocentia ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponentem dogmata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all this the honour of the Church was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted; But buſineſs of weight and truſt was committed to them: <hi>Valent. Valens</hi> appointed Biſhops to ſet the price of goods ſold with this reaſon, <hi>Negotiatores ne modum mercandi videantur excedere, Epiſcopi Chriſtiani quibus verus cultus eſt adjuvare pauperes, provideant. Juſtin.</hi> 79. <hi>Novel,</hi> ſubmits Monks to the Juriſdiction of Biſhops <hi>Novel</hi> 83. he decrees the like for Clerks, as well for matters Civil, as for Eccleſiaſtical Crimes, reſerving others to his officers; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, in caſe the Biſhops cannot or will not take cogniſance of them, he refers them to his Magiſtrates.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56755:17"/>
               <p>Nay, the Emperours proceeded further, and did give Juriſdiction to Biſhops, not only over Clerks, but alſo over Laymen. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great (whoſe Law the Canoniſts aſcribe to <hi>Theodoſius</hi>) made a very favourable conſtitution in behalf of Biſhops; whereupon he gives them the Cogniſance of all civil Cauſes betwixt Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, upon the bare demand of one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, albeit the other did not conſent unto it, in ſuch ſort as the Magiſtrates are bound to deſiſt from the Cogniſance of it, as ſoon as one of the parties ſhall require to be diſmiſt and ſent thither, whether it be at the beginning or middle or end of the ſuit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> derogating from this Law, will have it to be by the joint conſent of both parties, and that by way of Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The ſame Emperours together with <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> do ordain, That there ſhall be no appeal from the Epiſcopal Judgment, and that their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſhall be put in execution by the Serjeants and Officers of the Judges.</p>
               <p>The two laſt, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> would have to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; for as for that of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> he did not inſert it in his Books, which <hi>Gratian</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in his decrees: and whereas in the Code of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> the inſcription of the Title runs thus, <hi>De Epiſcopali Judicio; Juſtinian</hi> inſtead of it hath put <hi>De Epiſcopali audientia,</hi> to ſhew that it is not properly any Jurisdiction that is beſtowed upon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56755:17"/> them but a friendly and arbitrary compoſition to abridge proceſs.</p>
               <p>After this the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Great in his Capitulary renewed the Law of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and gave the ſame juriſdiction therein contained unto all the Biſhops, repeating the ſame Law, word for word; which the Popes have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in their Decrees, where they have inſerted the Conſtitution of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> under the name of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> juſt as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> did in his Books, the Reſponſes and Commentaries of Lawyers to give them the ſtrength of a Law.</p>
               <p>But I know there is a Queſtion made by very Learned men, Whether that Law of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is not ſuppoſititious? But whether it be or be not, we have alledged enough without it to prove that Chriſtian Emperors, and the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church was not of the opinion of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and that his Citations ſo much as they are true, are nothing to his purpoſe; The cauſe or reaſon of thoſe two Laws expreſſed in the Laws are, For that the authority of Sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion invents and finds out many means of allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Suits, which the Tyes and Forms of capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pleadings will not admit of; That the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Biſhops are true and uncorrupted; That this is the choaking of thoſe malicious ſeeds of Suits; To the intent that poor men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the long and laſting ſnares of tedious Actions, may ſee how to put a ſpeedy end to thoſe unjuſt demands which were propoſed to them.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56755:18"/>
               <p>But the Pope his Decretals, the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Eccleſiaſtical Courts are of old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, as the ſource of Iniquity and injuſtice, and of all the ſhufflings and tricks that ever could be invented in matter of pleading, and that all Papal Chriſtendome hath groaned miſerably under them; and I wiſh that we may never hear duly of any ſuch complaints of our Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Courts.</p>
               <p>It is worth obſerving how the Church and Common-wealth did Actions contrary to each other in purſuance of their ſeveral intereſts. The Common-wealth endeavour'd to engage Biſhops in the higheſt ſecular affairs and in their ſupream Judicatures, and ſo the people would have it, not doubting of ſuch admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations as they might fairly expect from the Biſhops ability, Authority and Religion. But on the other ſide the Church did as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them as ſhe could, and ſo far as ſhe might, ſhe uſed her Reſtraint only in prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them from medling for their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gain in Temporal affairs. <hi>Can.</hi> 14. <hi>Arles, clericus turpis lucri gratia aliquid genus negotii non admittat:</hi> but they did not take from them all opportunities both of doing good to their people and ſecuring the Secular power (of which they became part) to their own aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and without refuſing their ſervices to the Prince when required: from which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church, the Pope took advantage
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56755:18"/> to put his peremptory reſtraints upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy from intermedling in Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affairs to make them the more ſubmitted and dependent upon himſelf, the better to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to his Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy. The Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and favours that Biſhops received at the Courts of Princes, was the envy of the Pope, and matter of quarrel againſt them; and <hi>Petrus Bliſſenſis,</hi> upon ſuch an occaſion makes an Apologie to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, in an Epiſtle writ in the Name of the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in defence of the Biſhops of <hi>Ely, Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> who attended then at Court upon the ſervice of the King: which becauſe he hath been an Author produced by the other ſide in this Cauſe, and becauſe what he ſays for their being admitted into the Councels of Princes, contains ſo many advantages to the Church and State, I ſhall here tranſcribe; <hi>Non eſt novum quod Regum Conciliis interſint Epiſcopi, ſicut enim honeſtate &amp; ſapientia caeteros antecedunt, ſic expeditiores &amp; efficaciores in Reipub. admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratione cenſentur; quia ſicut ſcriptum eſt (minus ſalubriter diſponitur regnum, quod non regitur conſilio Sapientum) in quo notatur eos conſiliis regum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere aſſiſtere qui ſciant &amp; velint &amp; poſſint patienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus compati, terrae ac populi ſaluti proſpicere erudire adjuſtitiam Reges, imminentibus occurſare, periculis, vitaeque maturioris exemplis informare ſubditos, &amp; quadam Authoritate poteſtativa praeſumptionem ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignantium cohibere:</hi> He proceeds in his diſcourſe,

               <p>ANd now we proceed to the Precedents, of which the <hi>Octavo</hi> Book principally conſiſts, which ſeem, as that Author and the other in <hi>Folio</hi> would have it, to be not only a diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Right of the Biſhops to judge in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Cauſes, but an argumentative proof that they never had any; becauſe it can as they ſay be never proved to be otherwiſe. Immemorial time I confeſs is a great evidence, of the right whether <hi>In non uſer</hi> or <hi>uſer,</hi> and a fair reaſon to allow or deny the pretence; and therefore we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56755:20"/> will now conſider the Precedents: As for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative and diſcourſive parts of thoſe books they will fall in to be anſwered by way of Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when we are diſcourſing and proving the affirmative part of the Queſtion, and will beſt be reproved by being placed near the light of our reaſons for eſtabliſhing the Right of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</p>
               <p>If we do not give ſome ſatisfaction to theſe Precedents, whatever we ſhall ſay, I know can ſignifie no more than an Argument to prove a thing not true, which is poſſible, <hi>&amp; de facto,</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by unexceptionable witneſſes; for ſuch the Precedents will be taken until exceptions are made to their Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>The Precedents produced by the two Authors are moſtly the ſame, only the <hi>Octavo</hi> hath more than what the <hi>Folio</hi> Book hath recited.</p>
               <p>The firſt caſe that the <hi>Octavo</hi> produceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lords Spiritual, their Right of being Judges in Parliament in Capital Cauſes, is that of <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March, Simon Bereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and others (who were no Peers, and yet tryed in Parliament) and no Biſhops preſent; and we agree it probable for his reaſon, becauſe there is mention made of Counts, Barons, and Peers, and Peers being named after Barons could not comprehend the Biſhops. And becauſe we think it reaſonable, when the orders of that Houſe are particularly enumerated, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der omitted ſhould be intended abſent; but we
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56755:20"/> will not allow but that Peers is, and ſo is Grants comprehenſive of Biſhops: Nor will we when the entry is General intend the Biſhops abſent, except he cannot otherwiſe prove them abſent, which we mention in the entry once for all, as juſt and common meaſures between us in this diſpute. It will appear true what we affirm of the words, <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Grants,</hi> by what follows: And if we ſhould not inſiſt upon their being preſent, when nothing appears to the contrary, we ſhould do wrong to the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>But to come to the conſideration of this Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: Is this a juſt Precedent? Is not <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> hereby violated? Are not the proceedings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together illegal? Here are Commoners tryed by Peers in Parliament. It is well known, that the high diſpleaſure of the King was concerned, and that he did interpoſe with a plenitude of Power in this particular caſe againſt the fundamental conſtitutions of the Government; the greateſt crime of this Earl was too much familiarity with the Kings Mother, Indignation and Revenge and not Juſtice formed the Proceſs, It was proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to condemn him <hi>Judicio Zeli,</hi> upon pretence of the Notoriety of the fact.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> in his abridgment tells us <hi>Anno</hi> 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. That the King charged the Peers (who as Judges of the Land, by the Kings aſſent adjudged) that the ſaid <hi>Roger</hi> as a Traytor ſhould be drawn and hanged. The Biſhops were not preſent, certainly they were none of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56755:21"/> Judges that gave Judgment as the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced without Cogniſance of the Cauſe; The King had more Honour for their Order, than to call then to ſuch Drudgery and ſervice of the Crown: The iniquity of the ſentence appears by the reverſal thereof in Parliament, 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. in which the Original Record is recited: Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> in his Abridgment tells us, That this Earl being condemned of certain points whereof he deſerved commendation, and for other alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether untrue ſurmiſes, there was a Bill brought into the Lords Houſe for the reverſal of the Judgment, and it was reverſt by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; indeed it could not be otherways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt: for no Court can judicially reverſe their own Judgment; for Error in Law and Judgment in the Lords Houſe, (being the <hi>dernier Reſort</hi>) cannot be repealed, but undone it may be by themſelves in their legiſlative Capacity. Here ſaith the <hi>Octavo,</hi> the Biſhops were not preſent at the paſſing of that Bill, but yet the <hi>Octavo</hi> Gentleman will not pretend that the Biſhops are to be excluded in any Acts of Legiſlation. Why therefore was he ſo willing to impoſe upon the people ſo falſely, and unrighteouſly, and to produce this as a Precedent againſt the Biſhops Right of Seſſion in matters of that Nature, by himſelf recognized? There is nothing can excuſe him herein, for he is certainly ſelf-condemned of undue Art in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> matter.</p>
               <p>In 20 <hi>R.</hi> 2. the Caſe of Sir <hi>Thomas Haxey</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56755:21"/> happen'd, which the <hi>Octavo</hi> book (page 20) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth againſt us. He was forſooth condemned in Parliament, for that he had preferred a Bill in the Houſe of Commons, for regulating the outragious Expences of the Kings Houſe, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of Biſhops and Ladies. <hi>Haxey</hi> was for this tryed, and condemned to death for it in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And here appears to be no Biſhops, and there ought not to have been any for theſe reaſons. Firſt, that the Biſhops were the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wronged, and therefore could not in any fitneſs give ſentence; But Secondly, (if that was not in the Caſe) that that caus'd the proceſs was Royall anger upon a great faction of State, (in which I believe the Biſhops were not engaged) made for depoſing of <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2d. that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the King to be in acting, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by Sir <hi>Thomas Haxey</hi> by his Bill. It was this made the ſentence altogether abhorrent from legal juſtice in matter and form. Here was a Tryall of a Commoner by Peers, a matter made Treaſon, that did participate nothing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Treaſon. But the diſcreet Gentleman will take notice of nothing that is faulty in this Caſe, but that this proceeding tends to abridge freedom of ſpeech in Parliament, which he loved from his youth, which we do not blame in him: As he did alſo to talk againſt Biſhops, which he cannot depart from, when he is old. But in the firſt of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. this Judgment of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder</hi> was repealed and annull'd, as he himſelf
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56755:22"/> tells us <hi>Fol.</hi> 25. And here the Lords Spiritual were Judges, which muſt be remark't for the honour of their Order, that though they were the <hi>pars laeſa,</hi> by that fault, ſuch as it was; yet notwithſtanding they concurred readily to the repealing the Judgment.</p>
               <p>But by this it appears that the Biſhops did agreeable to their rightful Authority, ſit in Judgment in Parliament in capital Cauſes; and therefore in conſequence, becauſe it is a Caſe of his own production, he ought to allow that the Biſhops might have had Seſſion in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of the Attainder of <hi>Roger</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> if it had been, or could have been repealed by Judgment, or a judicial Act of the Lords Houſe.</p>
               <p>For will this renownedly wiſe-man, for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this his own teſtimony which he hath juſtly produced (though it proves to teſtify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf) ſay, that the Biſhops can be preſent at repealing of a Judgment of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but not preſent at confirming any?</p>
               <p>Doth not it, in this proceeding come before them in Judgment, and conſideration, Whether the ſentence ſhall be repealed or affirmed, and is not this with a witneſs, a queſtion of blood? The Judgment being upon an appeal or review muſt be final, peremptory and decretory, and is more a queſtion of blood, than the Cauſe can be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deem'd to be upon the firſt Inſtance. Or doth he think fit that there ſhould be two
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56755:22"/> ſorts of Judges appointed, a hanging Judge, and a ſaving Judge; if he doth, I am ſure he will not be able to find an employment for a juſt Judge.</p>
               <p>So that, I think, to all men that can conſider, we have ſufficiently vacated that teſtimony, that the Caſes of the Earl <hi>March</hi> and <hi>Haxey</hi>'s ſeem'd to give againſt us, and they are fairly come over to our ſide. And we have provided herein ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for the recovering of all men into an indifferency againſt the Prejudices, this <hi>Octavo</hi> by its great Eſteem hath done to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The Third Precedent is, 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. That Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was declared to be called for the Redreſs of the breach of the Laws, and of the Peace of the Kingdom, and as the <hi>Octavo</hi> hath it <hi>Fol.</hi> 8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prelates were of opinion, that it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not properly to them to give Councel about keeping the peace, nor puniſhing ſuch evils; they went away by themſelves, and returned no more (ſaith he) but that is out of the Record, (ſo ready this Authour in <hi>Octavo</hi> is to ſhut them out of the Houſe;) but I pray would not the Temporal Lords, if the King had conſulted the Parliament in matters Eccleſiaſtical, have in like manner departed, but would ſuch depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Temporal Lords exclude them from having any thing to do in the Affairs of the Church; Why then are the Biſhops treated in their Right ſo unequally?</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56755:23"/>
               <p>And this muſt ſerve for an Anſwer to the <hi>Folio,</hi> p. 17. where he is very large in reciting Records of proceſs, and Proclamation againſt the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> agreed only by Lords. If a Liturgy, or book of Canons were to be eſtabliſhed by Law, the Biſhops certainly would have the forming of them. The <hi>Octavo</hi> ſaith, that Commiſſions were then framed by the Counts, Barons, and other Grants, and brought into Parliament, but no Biſhop was preſent, ſo much as to hear the Commiſſions read; becauſe they were to enquire into all Crimes, as well Capital, as others. And for affirming this (for all that can appear to us) he only conſulted his Will and pleaſure like an honeſt man, to the cauſe he defends, for he hath not told us from any Record, what the Nature of theſe Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were. But we obſerve, that though this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was called for matters of the peace, yet the Biſhops had their Summons, and it was not a Parliament <hi>excluſo Clero.</hi> The Biſhops it ſeems upon the opening of the Parliament, and the cauſes of convening, modeſtly, it ſeem'd, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they were not competent, as not perhaps ſtudied in Pleas of the Crown, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had not been ſo obſervant in fact, of the matters of grievance. What harm in all this? they that cannot propound may judge of Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents propounded, and ſo did they; for it doth appear by the Record 6 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>N.</hi> 3. that the Reſults of the Temporal Lords were approved
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56755:23"/> in full Parliament, by the King, Biſhops, Lords and Commons, which the <hi>Folio</hi> agrees. But it ſeems modeſty is a dangerous thing; and not to be forward to judge and determine, though the matter be not underſtood, may be a good Cauſe to turn a Judge out of his Office, and forfeit his Judicature. Beſides, the principal buſineſs of this Parliament was Legiſlation, in which the Prelates have an undiſputed Right of Seſſion, and may they not adviſe upon what they make into a Law? May not they conſider of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is to paſs into a Law in all the ſteps it makes?</p>
               <p>But it is admirable what the <hi>Folio</hi> Book ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> that by this Record it is evident that the Prelates have no judicial power over any perſonal Crimes, which are not Parliamentary (I ſuppoſe he means Crimes not debated in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) This doth very much fortify the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and grounds of his diſcourſe. What are the grounds of his diſcourſe, I ſhall never be able to find out, except it be an over-weening Opinion of himſelf to meddle with theſe matters which ſeem too high for him; and to which the reading of my Lords <hi>Cooks</hi> Inſtitutes, and the broken Commentaries of the Law, will never render any man competent.</p>
               <p>Its true the Biſhops have never any power and Cognizance of any Cauſes, except they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated thereto, out of Parliament. But as true it is of the Temporal Lords; and therefore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56755:24"/> whatſoever advantage this will do his Cauſe, with all my heart let him take it.</p>
               <p>The next Caſe produced as a Precedent for them, is the Caſe of Sir <hi>William de La Zouch,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Gray,</hi> for a quarrel in the Kings preſence; they were both committed to the Tower, and after brought into Parliament, no Biſhops there.</p>
               <p>It is a Caſe that could not be judged there, neither was it; but one of them was diſcharged, becauſe no probable matter of offence againſt him, and the other remanded to the Tower, (I ſuppoſe) to be proceeded againſt as the Law required. Is this cauſe (I pray) to his purpoſe? have not the Prelates judgment in cauſes of Treſpaſs, that properly come before that Houſe by his own Confeſſion? And yet the <hi>Octavo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks here, that no Biſhops were preſent to judge ſo much as of a Battery; though the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord warrants him to ſay only an Aſſault. But out of his great ſincerity, and to make a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent where he could not find one for his turn, he foiſts a Battery into the Caſe, hoping that then the forward Reader would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Reſt, and ſmell blood in the Caſe, which muſt be interdicted to a Biſhops Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance.</p>
               <p>But obſerve what an aking-tooth he hath againſt the Biſhops Right; for he could not but have in his mind, what almoſt immediately after, he writes down in his <hi>Octavo (viz.)</hi> the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56755:24"/> Caſe of Sir <hi>John Lee,</hi> 24 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and of ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and 51 <hi>E.</hi> 3. cenſured in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by Biſhops for miſdemeanors. And he ſaith well they might; which certainly together with the Caſe of <hi>Michael de la Pooll,</hi> 10 <hi>R.</hi> 2. he troubled himſelf to tranſcribe, to make a ſhew of Number and falſe muſters, a ſleight that muſt not paſs upon the people, and a Stratagem that will never get him any advantage towards a Victory.</p>
               <p>We omitted to conſider the Caſe of Sir <hi>William de Thorpe</hi> 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. as it lies in order in his Book, becauſe we thought it more expedite to examine thoſe that ſpake to the ſame thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but now we will examine it. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of a Judgment of death againſt him for Buggery, was brought into Parliament, ſaith the <hi>Octavo;</hi> in full Parliament ſaith Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> and the King cauſed it to be read before the Grants in Parliament: The Biſhops (ſaith the <hi>Octavo</hi>) could not be there, becauſe this was no imployment for them; and thus he proves his cauſe, it was ſo, becauſe it was ſo. And for want of proof concludes he hath a very good Cauſe: But he knows if he would tell us the truth, that a full Parliament doth include Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; that the Biſhops are truly Grants and ſo called, that the Biſhops could not vaniſh away, at the putting of the queſtion. But we ſhould have had a moſt famous Record of that ſtory and wonderful Accident.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56755:25"/>
               <p>The Cauſe of <hi>William de Weſton</hi> and <hi>John de Gomenits</hi> 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. was for traiterouſly ſurrendring Towns and Caſtles in <hi>Flanders</hi> to the Kings Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And the queſtion was, whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves well in their defence, and did therein like valiant and faithful Commanders; Whether the Towns could be preſerved againſt the ſtrength of the Enemies that did attach them. Indeed not a very proper queſtion for a Biſhop to determine: The Examination of the Charge and defence was committed to ſeveral Lords Temporal, named in the Record; But it muſt be obſerved, though theſe Lords managed the Cauſe, found the Towns upon Examination, not of neceſſity, but willfully delivered, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed what Judgment ſhould be pronounced againſt them: Yet obſerve their Anſwers were put in full Parliament. When the Judgment was pronouncing, there was likewiſe ſitting a full Parliament, which the <hi>Octavo</hi> doth wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omit. And the Record further ſaith, that they were brought before the <hi>Seigniors</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Friday</hi> the 27. of <hi>November,</hi> and again, before the ſaid Lords, <hi>Saturday</hi> the 28. of <hi>Nov.</hi> That all this while in the Record, there is no mention of the Names of any particular Lords, ſo that we hear nothing yet in the Record, but of a full Parliament, Seigniors in Parliament, which are the moſt comprehenſive terms, and can, and do include Biſhops, and ſtrongly intend them included. He that ſaith all, excepts none,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56755:25"/> the Record ſaith, that when the Judgment was to be pronounced, <hi>Les Seigniors dudit Parliament ceſtaſcavoir,</hi> and then names the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> Earls of <hi>Cambridge, March, Arundel, Warwick, Stafford, Suffolk, Salisbury, Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> Lord <hi>Nevil</hi> and <hi>Clifford;</hi> and other Lords, Barons and Bannerets being then in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, had met and adviſed upon the matters before. Theſe Lords agreed it ſeems the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the whole Houſe, and it was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in full Parliament; and that in the Names and Authority of the whole Parliament. Pray let it be obſerved, that when the Record ſpeaks of Seigniors, in the firſt part of it, no Lords are named, and ſo all intended; when afterwards he mentions the Lords, the Record ſaith <hi>avantdits,</hi> or foreſaid Lords, and no Lords named yet, ſo that all the Lords of Parliament are then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe included: But when he names the Lords that had adviſed, there is no <hi>avantdits,</hi> or afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. Though the <hi>Octavo</hi> puts the <hi>avantdits,</hi> or the aforeſaid to the named Lords, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that it may ſeem, that no Lords were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in this Cauſe before in Parliament, but thoſe named and mentioned, amongſt the which there were no Biſhops, againſt the Faith of the Record. To the Record I appeal. <hi>Rot. Parl.</hi> 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Mem.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>The next is Sir <hi>Ralph Ferrers</hi> his Caſe, 4 <hi>R.</hi> 2. He was brought into Parliament, and there try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Treaſon, in holding intelligence with the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56755:26"/> French. The Entry is, <hi>It ſeem'd to the Lords of the Parliament, that the ſaid Sir</hi> Ralph <hi>was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> This teſtimony too is <hi>argumentative,</hi> and concludes Biſhops not there, becauſe not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, as they were in <hi>Alice Perries</hi> Caſe, 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. I never could have a good opinion of a cauſe, that hath nothing but <hi>argumentative</hi> proofs, for this reaſon; becauſe there are more things poſſible than ever happen'd; but a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning Witneſs is always accounted a willing Witneſs, and therefore a Witneſs <hi>ſuſpectae fidei;</hi> but moſt certain, a Witneſs with a reaſon His teſtimony is no better than his reaſon. But I pray muſt the Entries of the Clerks be ſo nicely weighed? Are they ſo oracularly penned, that every <hi>iota</hi> of the Journal muſt comprehend a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of State, and carry in it the very conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government? muſt that be ſuch and no other, than ſhort or large Entries make it? Muſt a Criticiſm upon the Clerks form of Entry alter and refix the Government? muſt it change and be ambulatory at the haſte or leaſure, the ſhort or more large Entry of the Clerk? Did ever any wiſe man, before this Criticiſer, ever determine queſtions of the greateſt moment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch trifling conſiderations? or ſuſpend the moſt <hi>momentous concerns</hi> of a Nation, the very Government it ſelf, upon ſuch a very ſlender thread? But to leave no ſcope for ſuch Cavilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we will turn him to the <hi>Parl. Rolls</hi> of 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Were not the Grants the Biſhops, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56755:26"/> well as the Temporal Lords? Are not both Biſhops and Peers called Seigniors? Are not Seigniors and Grants of the ſame import? And as certainly this <hi>argumentative</hi> teſtimony makes no credit to the Cauſe, nor to the Author of the <hi>Octavo</hi> who produc'd it.</p>
               <p>The next Caſe is of the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> 7 <hi>R.</hi> 2. who is brought to Judgment in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, amongſt other offences, for betraying <hi>Graveling</hi> to the French, which was Treaſon. And this cauſe the Record ſaith, was heard before the Lords Temporal: And here I will agree that the Biſhops were not preſent, but I will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they were excluded. And if that addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Temporal</hi> had been to the Seigniors in Sir <hi>Ralph Ferrers</hi> Caſe, or to the Grants in Sir <hi>Wil. Thorps,</hi> I would have allowed the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in thoſe Caſes not preſent likewiſe. But why I pray may it not be with as much fairneſs concluded that the Biſhops were preſent (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the addition of Temporal is not made to Seigniors and Grants) in the ſaid Caſes of Sir <hi>Ralph Ferrers,</hi> and Sir <hi>Wil. Thorp,</hi> as it can be that they were abſent in the hearing of the ſaid Caſes, becauſe the word Prelate or Biſhop, is not in thoſe Entries expreſſed? If he will be juſt and change the Tables, He muſt yield us the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, for he knows that there is no eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in the <hi>Modus tenendi Parliamentum,</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Forms of Entries, or any <hi>ſolemnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulae,</hi> whoſe import and value is aſcertained
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56755:27"/> and made indiſputable, but are to be expounded by an eaſy interpretation; ſuch as we uſe, when we make fair conſtructions in common ſpeech. But to give this another Anſwer, The Arguer is herein guilty of that fallacy which they call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa;</hi> And his Witneſs doth not ſpeak <hi>ad idem.</hi> The Biſhop was an Eccleſiaſtical perſon, and though the Biſhops might try a Temporal Lord for the ſame offence, yet they would not conſent to try a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and forgo that great priviledge of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, with ſo much earneſtneſs defended in that Age, to be exempt from <hi>ſecular Judicatures.</hi> They would not be preſent to try, becauſe of the perſon of the Defendant, which cannot be drawn into Argument to prove that they had no cognizance of the Cauſe with any fairneſs.</p>
               <p>But further the <hi>Octavo</hi> doth afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Teſtimony that doth contradict this laſt Teſtimony in the point for which he produc'd it. It is the Caſe of <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. The Biſhops pronounced Judgment againſt him in Treaſon by their Proxy. They can it ſeems upon great Reaſons wave that priviledge, and ſubmit a great Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> own Order to Juſtice, as they did in the Caſe of <hi>Becket</hi> heretofore. So that you ſee here, they uſed a Juriſdiction in a Cauſe of Treaſon in the Caſe of <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> which the Biſhops could not have uſed without a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56755:27"/> Right; And the Caſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> is only an omiſſion conſiſtent with a Right.</p>
               <p>The Caſe of Sir <hi>William Rikehill</hi> is next in order, who was ſent by <hi>R.</hi> 2. to <hi>Calais,</hi> to take the Confeſſion of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who ſoon after was Murdered. The Judge was arreſted and brought into Parliament before the King, Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons; the whole matter was examined, and the Judge was examined. Here is likewiſe a clear Caſe for the Biſhops, an Inſtance wherein they did take cognizance of a Capital Cauſe in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the <hi>Octavo</hi> hath a Shift for us, and ſays that there was no impeachment or charge againſt the Judge, and ſo the Biſhops might be preſent at his Examination. Let the Reader here obſerve the ſleights, wriglings and prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of this <hi>Octavo</hi> Author; Whatever the World thinks of this Author, I am much diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed about him, and cannot believe him a man indifferent and impartial in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
               <p>In his obſervations of the Parliament of the 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Biſhops he ſaith vaniſhed like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they went away immediately at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That <hi>matters of the Peace</hi> in general were to be treated of (wherein Blood and Member might not at all be concerned, for all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.) They went away and (as he would have it) they returned no more: and they muſt not hear ſo much as a Commiſſion of the Peace read.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56755:28"/> But here in this Caſe of <hi>Rikehill</hi> they may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a Murder. He will ſay (I am ſure) that though the Biſhops did examine it, they could make no judgment of the matter. But who will believe him? In the Caſe of <hi>de la Zouch</hi> and <hi>Gray,</hi> he obſerves that Biſhops could not be preſent ſo much as at a Battery, though there was no Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in the Caſe, and yet he allows them to judge of all miſdemeanors in the ſame little Book.</p>
               <p>I obſerve but theſe things, of many more of like nature, which the Reader may obſerve of himſelf, in that little <hi>Octavo;</hi> that the World may judge, how unjuſtly he deals in this Cauſe: with what iniquity and prevarication he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a noble queſtion of Right concerning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Kingdom. With what petulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſpight, and inveterate diſpleaſure, he uſeth the Biſhops. That he is grinning at them, whetting his teeth, and ſquinting upon them perpetually with an evil Eye. He oppugns their Right with Cavillations upon the Clerks Entries, with what is in the Record, and what is not, and what he is pleaſed to add of his own upon them, and with Precedents that reprove one another. Had it not been more fair for him to have ſtated the Right upon a probable reſult of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords conſidered together, than to make their Right ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to affirm, ſometimes to deny their Right, in the ſame little <hi>Octavo?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56755:28"/>
               <p>He cannot ſure think that every Judgment that hath been given upon deliberation in the greateſt Judicature, can uncontroulably make the Law; much leſs a Fact, much leſs an Omiſſion, a Negative that can operate nothing. If nothing be Law but what hath always and conſtantly been done in the ſame manner and form, and all circumſtances the ſame, as this Author it ſeems would have it; and nothing true Theology (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi> his Rule) but what hath been received <hi>ab omnibus, ubique &amp; ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> We can have no Law, nor no Theology. Vain and idle opinions muſt be diſcharged, ſuch as can have no conſideration with wiſe men; and the Law muſt be declared by the Nature of Government, reaſon, and the general order of things. But we have made too long an Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, We muſt return to a further conſideration of <hi>Rikehil</hi> his Caſe.</p>
               <p>And now I ſubmit it to any impartial man, whether the Judge could be arreſted and brought under an Arreſt into the Parliament, and be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and not accuſed.</p>
               <p>The very next Caſe he recites is that of <hi>John Hall,</hi> in which we find nothing but an Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and confeſſal; upon which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as a Traytor. And ſo would it have fared with Sir <hi>William Rikehil</hi> without doubt, if he had been guilty and had confeſſed. Neither the <hi>Octavo,</hi> nor Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> mentions any formality more againſt the one than the other.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:56755:29"/>
               <p>The Houſe of Lords are not tyed to Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their proceedings like other inferior Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures: and the more inferior any Court is, the more regular forms are exacted, and that with great reaſon, which we will not hear treat of. Beſides, in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> recited in the <hi>Octavo</hi> Book <hi>Fol.</hi> 34. in 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. a Judgment was given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for an offence upon a petition, which he exhibited for a pardon of the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>But in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> I pray obſerve what the <hi>Octavo</hi> ſaith in reference to our queſtion. After he hath recited part of the Record in theſe words; [The petition being read and underſtood, the Lords as Peers of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to whom ſuch Judgment doth of Right appertain, did give their Judgment] He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that the Biſhops could not he ſaid to be his Peers, which ſhews they were not there. But he muſt give us leave with much better Logick, to conclude, that they were preſent; and We with reaſon preſume, becauſe they are Peers of Parliament (for ſo the Record is, not <hi>his</hi> Peers, for he fallaciouſly changeth the Terms) they were there, except he can prove them abſent, if common Right is not Reaſon of preſumption, no preſumption can be reaſonable. But we can prove to him they were there. And thereby in conſequence, we have another proof that they are Peers.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56755:29"/>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Abridgment tells us 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Fol.</hi> 426. that at the ſame time the Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, at their own requeſt, (and therefore certainly then preſent) were purged from ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Treaſon by the ſaid Earl. And at the ſame time, I pray obſerve, Sir <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> his levying of War was adjudged <hi>Treaſon</hi> by the King and Lords in full Parliament. Note, that here is ſaid to be a full Parliament, and yet nothing in the Entry, but the ſtile of Lords. So various and contingent in reſpect of form are the Entries; which ought to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>But to review and conſider again the Caſe of <hi>John Hall</hi> condemned in Parliament for Treaſon, for murdering the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> And to this place I have reſerved the Caſe of the two Merchants that killed <hi>John Imperial</hi> an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>Genoua;</hi> for both Caſes are of the ſame nature, and muſt receive the ſame anſwer; and that is this. The Statute of the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was made to declare certain matters Treaſon, and to be ſo judged in ordinary Judicatures: but withall that Statute did provide, that if any other Caſe, ſuppoſed Treaſon, do happen, it ſhall be ſhewed to the King and Parliament, whether it ought to be judged Treaſon. Concerning which the King and Parliament do and are to declare by their Legiſlative power, as it is agreed by all, and as they did in the Caſe of <hi>John Imperial,</hi> as appears by that Record expreſly. So that though the Biſhops were not preſent at the Judgment of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56755:30"/> 
                  <hi>John Hall,</hi> they might have been (it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by our Adverſary) if the Judgment againſt <hi>John Hall</hi> was by the Legiſlative Power, as it muſt be. By this it appears how falſe an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this of his is, To conclude no Right from abſence; for it is plain, here it proves too much, it proves a thing notoriouſly falſe, a thing falſe by the confeſſion of our Adverſary: and from what any falſhood may be inferred, is not it ſelf true, but ſtands reproved by the falſhood and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of what follows in conſequence thereof. But this is too Solemn Reproof of ſo frivolous an Argument, for it is no more in effect than this: That no man can have an Authority, but what he is always in the exerciſe of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Octavo</hi> goes on, and remembers that in the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. the firſt Writ <hi>de Haeretico comburendo</hi> was framed by the Lords Temporal only; and without queſtion it was ſo. For the order of proceedings in Caſe of Hereticks Convict, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it. The Biſhops are upon the Matter, the <hi>pars laeſa</hi> in Hereſy. The authority of the Church is therein offended, and it was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proper for an Eccleſiaſtick to be an Actor therein.</p>
               <p>The Author doth improve this, as he doth all things that he can with any manner of colour, to render the Order of Biſhops hated, and diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, which is the publick eſtabliſhment, the legal proviſion for the Government and guidance of Religion. What miſchief then is he a doing?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56755:30"/> How great is his fault to deprave that proviſion, to deſtroy their Reputation and Eſteem with the people, to deſtroy all their authority as much as in him lyeth? His utmoſt endeavours are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wanting, to make their Miniſtries uſeleſs, and to fruſtrate the proviſions of the Law, and the care of the Government, in the higheſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nation. Doth this become a great man? I will not ſay a good man? God rebuke him. To leſſen the Authority, and diſrepute and diſhonour any Order of men, or any Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that can be any ways uſeful to the publick, is a great fault: but this of his, is a moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous offence.</p>
               <p>But what can be inferred from hence againſt the Order of the Biſhops, may be with like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs inferred againſt the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf. For it may be as well concluded, that the Chriſtian Religion is a bad Religion; for that men of that denomination in the general Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, by pretence of Warranty from that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though it gave none, murdered innocents: As that the practices of the Biſhops of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſo depraved, do reflect any diſhonour againſt the Biſhops of reformed Chriſtianity. And this Anſwer will ſuffice too for the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Old-Caſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Earls of <hi>Kent, Huntingdon</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>le Deſpencer</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> before that, executed and declared Traytors in Parliament by the Lords Temporal only, in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56755:31"/> the Parliament of the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. and the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and Lord <hi>Bardolph,</hi> againſt whom it was proceeded in a Court of Chivalry after their death, who were declared Traytors after they were dead, in the Parliament in the 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>I hope the <hi>Octavo</hi> Gentleman, and all that are at preſent of his Opinion, will take this for a ſufficient Anſwer (if we had no more to ſay) that it was irregular, very irregular indeed, to condemn men after they were dead; when he himſelf would ſet aſide the Authority of the Caſe of <hi>William de la Poole</hi> in 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament where the Biſhops were preſent: which though he ſaith is the ſole ſingle precedent of Biſhops acting in Capital Cauſes, We ſhall therein convict him to be a man of Will, to have loſt himſelf in his paſſions, and his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And enter that Caſe with a cloud of other teſtimonies and reaſons that affirm, I will not ſtick to ſay, demonſtrate, (ſo as ſuch matters can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated) with a moral demonſtration, ſuch as ſhall leave no doubt with any man, of the Biſhops Right of judging in Capital cauſes in Parliament.</p>
               <p>But We ſhall further add for Anſwer that the Temporal Lords did not herein exerciſe the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Judge. For it could be no Judgment they delivered. It was only an officious decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, an avowing of the juſtneſs of the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of theſe great men, and to enter themſelves of the other ſide. But is it as reaſonable for this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56755:31"/> Writer, to fore-judge the Biſhops of their Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe, and to have it ſeized, becauſe they would not be guilty of a miſuſer thereof, and would not conſent to ſo inſolent a thing as to judge men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, nay when dead, and they could not be heard? And to kill over again the murdered Lords, for ſo they are in conſideration of the Law, who are not by legal proceſs condemned and executed.</p>
               <p>I cannot but obſerve in many of the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of State, and the <hi>ſimultates</hi> amongſt the Great men, and extravagant exceſſes of injuſtice, to the glory and honour of the Biſhops it muſt ever be remembred, that they did preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from being ingaged in ſuch violences as were committed againſt the laſt mentioned Lords.</p>
               <p>But that the Author of the <hi>Octavo</hi> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Mortimer</hi> againſt us, who was condemned upon a bare Indictment without Arraignment or due Tryal (a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Biſhops were not there) when he immediately after produceth the Caſe of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> wherein the Biſhops were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and will have it ſtand for nothing, becauſe in that, it was irregularly proceeded, is mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous partiality and iniquity. But in what I pray was the irregularity in the Caſe of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk?</hi> Why, becauſe the Commons deſired he might be committed upon a general Accuſation: But he was not. And the ſecond irregularity was, that ſome Prelates and ſome Lords ſhould be ſent
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56755:32"/> down to the Houſe of Commons, which is often done. But it is not the Prelates that he is thus concerned for, but that the Lords leſſened their Eſtate. This (to excuſe him) might make him very angry with that Caſe and quarrelſome. And yet after all there is a fallacy in the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Mortimer</hi> which he would put upon us, for Sir <hi>John Mortimer</hi> was condemned by Act of Parliament; and therefore the Biſhops might have been there if they had pleaſed, and that with his leave. For it was by the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> (who in the Kings abſence was commiſſionated to call and hold that Parliament) by the Advice of the Lords Temporal, at the prayer of the whole Commonalty in this preſent Parliament, and by the Authority thereof, ordered and decreed, that he ſhould be led to the Tower and from thence drawn to <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot therefore but obſerve how by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Canon a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſometimes, and by other prudent Arts and Receſſes from tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations, the Biſhops kept themſelves often from being engaged in the Animoſities of Great men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another: A matter remarkable for the commendation of their Exemplary Wiſdom and Juſtice, and a Recommendation of the men of that Order to be continued in the greateſt truſts that the Government hath committed to them.</p>
               <p>But now ſhortly and ſummarily to review what we have offered in the matter of Precedents, and together to conſider what true value and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56755:32"/> weight they are of, in the Caſes of <hi>Roger Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Haxey,</hi> and of Sir <hi>John Mortimer,</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. every body may ſee a reaſon why the Biſhops ſhould not act, if they had Authority, and therefore without wilfulneſs it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded they had none. Who ſees not that theſe Caſes are Precedents for us? for that the Biſhops judged in the Reverſal of the ſentence againſt <hi>Haxey,</hi> which if they had reaſon for it, they ought to have affirmed. And the Biſhops might have been preſent rightfully at the undoing the Attainder of <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> by the Confeſſions of theſe Authors.</p>
               <p>The Proceedings in the Parliament of 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. is a true argument of the Biſhops modeſty. But it proves more than he is willing to prove, if true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Biſhops cannot joyn in making Laws to puniſh publick Crimes, and therefore logically concludes nothing; beſides that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is falſe in fact, as it is alledged.</p>
               <p>The Caſes of Sir <hi>William Thorpe</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Ferrers</hi> (taken at beſt for him) are but militant, and have as much to ſay for, as againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops being there preſent. But to be true to the cauſe of the Biſhops, We have this advantage againſt him, that the Biſhops were always in the poſſeſſion of their Right, becauſe never fore-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it was once theirs, as we ſhall prove by and by: And this makes a preſumption that they always uſed it, when there is nothing to the contrary.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:56755:33"/>
               <p>The Biſhops were not preſent in the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi>'s Caſe: but the Biſhops may be at any time abſent upon a <hi>ſontica Cauſa.</hi> The defendant was a Biſhop, which was a very allowable one in thoſe times. But this muſt be conſidered with the Caſe of <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in whoſe judgment they were preſent virtually by their Proxy; and therefore had a Right to be there.</p>
               <p>The Caſe of <hi>John de Gomets,</hi> and <hi>William de Weſton</hi> is unduely, and againſt the faith of the Record produced againſt us; for upon the truth of the Record the Biſhops were preſent, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing that can be from thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Caſe of Sir <hi>William Rikehil</hi> 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. is for us, ſo is the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. The Caſe of <hi>John Hall</hi> who murdered the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and of the two Merchants that killed <hi>John Imperial</hi> the <hi>Genoua</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, 3 <hi>R.</hi> 2. are foreign to this queſtion, and ſo is the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Mortimer,</hi> except Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Authority and Legiſlative Authority in Blood, are of the ſame conſideration, as I think they are, and ſhall hereafter make out to be probable: and then thoſe Caſes are for our Right.</p>
               <p>They confeſs that the Biſhops might have been preſent if they pleaſed, and their abſence at the paſſing of thoſe Bills doth not conclude againſt their Right, themſelves being Judges.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:56755:33"/>
               <p>The Writ <hi>de haeretico comburendo,</hi> is of another conſideration, and doth not fall in with the preſent queſtion. There was no Judgment given, or to be given, in the Caſes of the Earl of <hi>Huntingdon, Kent, Salisbury,</hi> Lord <hi>Le Deſpencer,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Lumley,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and Lord <hi>Bardolph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe Precedents, ſuch as they are, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in no long Tract of time, but very tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous: Not one of them pretends to be an excluſion of the Biſhops upon Judgment or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive declaration of State. They pretend to be only inſtances of Omiſſion, or <hi>non uſer,</hi> which may well conſiſt with a Right. And yet contrary to the true import of theſe Precedents, and the true Nature of them, being only of Omiſſion and abſence of the Prelates; which as they are, can make no induction or eſtabliſh any propoſition, whereupon to frame an Argument or conclude a preſcription: Beſides that a preſcription is not poſſible in a meer negative, and to and of nothing. And where no body can uſe or poſſeſs that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in pretence in the defailance of the party to uſe it, whoſe Right it was. Beſides that it is not a preſcriptible matter (which we ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explain hereafter) it being in a matter of the Government, and a Right ariſing from its conſtitution: Contrary, I ſay, to the whole nature of the matter, He makes this Argument; <hi>à ſaepe facto ad jus valet argumentum.</hi> His Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould have been (if agreeable at all to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56755:34"/> matter) this, That where a Right is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not uſed, there can be no Right. But if this had been ſaid in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> every body would have condemned his reaſoning, and diſallowed, if not laughed at the Argument.</p>
               <p>So that we have left this Author neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Argument. We have ſtript the Cauſe of all the Precedents that pretend to favour it, and have left it <hi>Rara Avis</hi> indeed, but not <hi>nigro ſimil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lima Cygno,</hi> as the learned Author in <hi>Octavo</hi> hath it, with which he reproaches the Right of the Biſhops as aſſiſted only with a ſingle Precedent: But to a Bird of no colour at all, the bird in the Fable I mean, <hi>furtivis nudata coloribus,</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to laughter with its naked Rump.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>BUt if theſe Precedents had been all ſuch as they pretend to be, and the Biſhops not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Judgment, in any of thoſe Caſes which the <hi>Octavo</hi> and <hi>Folio</hi> have produced, and if they had been all Capital Cauſes that came in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Houſe, and all determined judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and not by the Legiſlative power of Parliament, and no reaſon was to be aſſigned for the Prelates abſence from the Nature of the Cauſe: If they had had no inducements to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56755:34"/> from any diſſatisfaction they had in the proſecution, and the pretended Right of the Church-men (in thoſe days much inſiſted upon) to be exempted from the jurisdiction of ſecular Courts, had not been the Cauſe of their abſence, which ſuppoſitions are not ſo in fact: And tho' the Biſhops had never uſed the Authority and power in queſtion as they have; yet if we can prove they had once a Right, thoſe Omiſſions of theirs, can be no prejudice to the meer-Right. (Though then (I confeſs) we ſhould labour a-the gainſt invincible prejudice in the Opinions of moſt.) 1. For that no man can loſe a Right by not uſing of it, but where that right can be uſurpt by another, and is ſo: And that uſurpation having been for immemorable time, when no body can tell when it was otherwiſe, ſhall in a matter preſcriptible be intended to be acquired by good Right; and that with great reaſon, in favour of poſſeſſion and the quieting of them; for that Eſtates and Rights can laſt longer than the Grants and Evidences or Records themſelves, that firſt created them. But where the nature of the Right is ſuch as this of the Biſhops in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is, which no body can uſe for them. For the Temporal Lords ſit in Judgment in their own Right, which is a plenary and compleat right, and cannot be made more or leſs. Secondly for that no Franchiſe, from the Power and Authority upward of a Court Leet, which can be neither more nor leſs by uſuage, than the Law hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56755:35"/> can be preſcribed to: And a <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> will fore-cloſe and extinguiſh an immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial uſuage of any irregular and illegal Franchiſe. A Right that can never be prejudged and fore-cloſed by <hi>non uſer,</hi> and ſuch is every Right that grows from the conſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though it ſhould be diſcontinued for a long tract of time, may be at any time right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and legally continued.</p>
               <p>The happineſs of our Caſe is, that we can point to the time when the Right of the Prelates to ſit in Judgment in Capital Cauſes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was eſtabliſhed; And which is more, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them, and they put under a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſory, and obliged by the Tenure of their Lands to ſerve the Crown in that capacity. And that was in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour: Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his Titles of honour, with great probability hath fixed it in the 4 year of his Reign, when he made the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks and Abbies ſubject to Knight ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in chief, by creation of new Tenures upon them, and ſo firſt turned their poſſeſſions into Baronies, and thereby made them Barons of the Kingdom by Tenure. This he ſaith is juſtified by <hi>Mat. Paris,</hi> and <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Windover,</hi> out of whom <hi>Mat. Paris</hi> took this Relation. <hi>Anno</hi> 1070. (ſo are their words) <hi>Rex Willielmus peſſimo uſus conſilio Epiſcopatus &amp; Abbatias omnes quae Baronias</hi> (that is by Anticipation; for the Lands made Baronies) <hi>tenebant in purâ &amp; perpetuâ, &amp; eatenus
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56755:35"/> ab omni ſervitute ſeculari libertatem habuerunt, ſub ſervitute ſtatuit militari,</hi> &amp;c. This he makes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther probable, for that in a Manuſcript Copy, which he uſed, in a very antient hand, theſe words are noted in the upper Margin over the year 1070. <hi>hoc anno ſervitium baroniae imponitur Rameſiae.</hi> It ſeems, ſaith he, the volumn belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Abby of <hi>Ramſey;</hi> And ſome Monk of the Houſe noted that in the Margin, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Abby, which equally concerned the reſt of the Abbies that were mentioned in that Relation; by their Lands being put under the Tenure by Barony, and they made Barons, they had a Right to ſit with the reſt of the Barons in Councellor Courts of Judgment; For ſaith Mr. <hi>Selden, tenere de Rege in capite, habere poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones ſicut Baroniam;</hi> and to be a Baron, and to have Right to ſit with the reſt of the Barons in Council or Courts of Judgment, according to the Laws of that time are <hi>Synonymies.</hi> So that there were no diſtinctions of Barons, as to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Authority, or Jurisdiction; but the Right of a Baron was the ſame, whether he was a Temporal or Spiritual Baron, for the Tenure of both is one and the ſame, and therefore the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices muſt be the ſame.</p>
               <p>The office (that is, the reſult of this Tenure) is the ſame in the Houſe of Lords, and indeed no office can be leſs than what the Law appoints it. The King cannot make a Peer, a Judge or a Biſhop, and put any Reſtraint upon the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56755:36"/> of the powers, and the <hi>jura ordinaria,</hi> that belongs by the appointment of the Law to a Peer, Biſhop or Judge. And that it is an office by Tenure, can make no difference, for the Law declares the Power and Authority: So that the Powers of all Barons are and muſt be equal, and what is allowed to one Baron cannot be denyed to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror made the Biſhops Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, by putting them to hold as by Barony, did not intend only the Biſhops more honour, but himſelf alſo more ſervice, and better aſſured. He cannot be intended (eſpecially) to abate them their ſervice in punitive or vindictive Juſtice, which a Conquerour of all other performances cannot want. I do not doubt, and if it were not unneceſſary to this queſtion, likewiſe to ſhew that before the Conqueſt, the Biſhops or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Lords had a great ſhare with the <hi>Thanes</hi> or Temporal Lords in the Government, and were then one of the three States, agreeable to all the <hi>Gothiſh Saxon</hi> (for the <hi>Saxons</hi> were <hi>Goths</hi> which we muſt not here inſiſt upon) and Modern Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments that have been planted in <hi>Europe,</hi> which we ſhall ſpeak to more hereafter: But we will reſort no higher than this of their becoming Barons by Tenure, in time of the Conquerour, for the clearing of the Prelates Right now in queſtion. And therefore we are not concerned to ſay any thing to the Caſe of <hi>E. Godwin,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Octavo,</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor's
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56755:36"/> time: For Brevity ſake, and becauſe we will not paſs the Limits of our own Arguments, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we had much to ſay againſt the Authority of that Sory, as it is by the <hi>Octavo</hi> mentioned.</p>
               <p>But to this day, neither in Record or Hiſtory, have we heard of any the leaſt pretence of any ſpecial abatement made of any ſervice due by the Tenures by Barony to any Biſhops or other Spiritual Baron by the Conquerour, at the time of the creating thoſe Tenures, neither did the Biſhops when they would fain have been excuſed from judging in Blood ever pretend to it, or make any ſuch excuſe, that their Tenures did not oblige them thereto.</p>
               <p>They have ever been eſteemed to have power of Judgment in Capital Cauſes in Parliament: and in a long tract of time, it hath been ſeveral ways uſed and acknowledged. Their Right is ſo far from being fore-judged, that it never till of late was brought in queſtion. They have pretended ſometimes that they ought not to uſe that Right in obſervation of the Canon Law, and have made their proteſtation according; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of neceſſity or choice ſhall be conſidered. They were upon the ſcore of the Canon Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in the Satute of <hi>Clarendon</hi> from being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and aſſiſting in giving the Judgment of Death and mutilation of Limb, yet their Right was not by that Statute deſtroyed or hurt, it put them only at liberty to uſe it, or not: but put no obligation or legal reſtraint upon them not to uſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56755:37"/> it. That Law was in favour of their Liberty, not a Reſtraint upon their Right.</p>
               <p>The words of that Law that concern this queſtion, we ſhall here ſet down. <hi>Archiepiſcopi, Epiſcopi &amp; univerſae perſonae Regni qui de Rege te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in capite, habeant poſſeſſiones ſuas de Rege ſicut Baroniam, &amp; inde reſpondeant Juſticiariis &amp; mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris Regis, &amp; ſequantur &amp; faciant omnes conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudines regias, &amp; ſicut caeteri Barones debent intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe judiciis Curiae quouſque perveniatur ad diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem membrorum vel ad mortem.</hi> Whether theſe words are words of Liberty or Reſtraint, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition or indulgence and favour, as alſo how far this favour, Liberty or Indulgence did extend, will appear clearly by the occaſion of the Law, and the Hiſtory of thoſe times, for whoſe ſake it was made, and upon what inducements, and how far they did uſe their Liberty afterwards.</p>
               <p>It is notorious that the deſign and endeavour of ſome Biſhops of that age, and before from the days of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, was to eſtabliſh an Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy in the Pope, to make themſelves the Grandees of another Kingdom, they endeavoured to exempt themſelves from all Civil ſubjection, as alſo from being any part of the Civil Government, over which their Church Empire was to rule and domineer. They looked upon their Baronies to be marks of Slavery, and inconſiſtent with their deſigned Church-empire, by which they were kept in ſubjection to the Government, and made a part of it, which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56755:37"/> was deſigned by the Conquerour, but moſt ſharply complained of, as may be ſeen in <hi>Mat. Paris. Rex Willielmus peſſimo uſus conſilio Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copatus ſub ſervitute ſtatuit militari, &amp; rotulas hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus Eccleſiaſticae ſervitutis ponens in Theſauris, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos viros Eccleſiaſticos huic conſtitutioni peſſimae reluctantes à Regno fugavit.</hi> If the Biſhops then had been ambitious and deſirous, that they might be as the reſt of the Barons were, Judges in the Kings Court, then it is true that the word <hi>quouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> muſt be a word of Excluſion, and that their pretence of judging was fore-cloſed to all matters under the <hi>quouſque.</hi> For if I ask a thing which is not my right, that which is not granted is denyed, and by ſuch denyall (in caſe of a Law declared,) the more unlawful. But this cannot poſſibly be, for they were already Barons, and Judges as other Barons. This they reckon'd a ſervitude, and was matter of grievance and complaint: But the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi> did proceed from the King, for the aſſerting his Soveraign Power, to reſiſt the deſign of the Papal Monarchy and to oblige the Biſhops to continue part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to tye them to the duty of their Tenures. <hi>Gervaſius</hi> tells us <hi>Col.</hi> 1386. that the Biſhops did not know what the <hi>Conſuetudines Eccleſiaſticae</hi> in the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi> were, but they imagined them to be evil, becauſe the King did ſo much inſiſt upon them. <hi>Neſciebant</hi> (ſaith he ſpeaking of the Biſhops) <hi>hujuſque quae eſſent illae conſuetudines, ſed pravas eſſe ſuſpicabantur, eo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56755:38"/> quod tantâ inſtantiâ peterentur.</hi> But the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as followeth, <hi>ſapientiâ provectiores, ite, diſquirite Avi mei conſuetudines, ut in ſcriptum redactae deducantur in medium &amp; publice recenſean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quas cum ſeorſum veteres actus &amp; pravitates,</hi> ſo he calls the Statutes of <hi>Clarendon, in ſcripta re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duxiſſent, haec tandem ſcripta modo Chirographi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulerunt,</hi> which the Arch-Biſhop was required to ſeal as the cuſtom then was in paſſing of Laws. It is likewiſe evident in the very Aſſiſe of <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that the Biſhops were then Barons, and ought to do the office of a Baron, and were by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Barons Judges, and ought <hi>intereſſe ſicut caeteri Barones Judiciis Curiae Domini Regis.</hi> But how far they ſhould by that Statute be bound here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, this Law was to determine: In conſequence the <hi>Quouſque</hi> is but a Clauſe of Liberty (at moſt) and the matter under it, left to choice. A pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge indeed the Biſhops might hereby obtain, to judge, or not to judge in Cauſes of blood, which they uſed in all after-times, as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as they did more or leſs regard the Canons, as either they did or were thought to intend. No right was hereby fore-cloſed of judging, but eſtabliſht, for the words are <hi>debent intereſſe. Quouſque</hi> is a Clauſe of exception, and leaves them in that matter at large, and ſavours not at all of a prohibition. But though the Biſhops might have ſuch a Liberty, by the Letter of the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> to judge, or not to judge at all in capital Cauſes, which doth not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56755:38"/> their Right, but that notwithſtanding they may uſe their rightful authority, when they pleaſe: Yet the Biſhops did not intend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves further priviledged by this Law, than that they ſhould not be obliged to be preſent at the pronouncing of the ſentence, which appears by the Canons that have been made about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>England,</hi> which we ſhall mention hereafter, which would have been moſt peremptory in their prohibitions and very ſevere in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Curſes, in a matter of this nature, as far as they had the Laws on their ſide. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the Practice of the Biſhops in thoſe times, which appears by <hi>Peter Bleſenſis,</hi> whoſe words are <hi>Principes ſacerdotum &amp; ſeniores populi,</hi> (by which he means the Biſhops, who from the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and worthineſs of their Order are called <hi>Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores,</hi> a note of dignity in all Countries, in all Ages, which I obſerve becauſe ſome are ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as not to know it, and think the Laity is meant by <hi>ſeniores populi,</hi> but if the Lay Barons had been guilty of that which he there complains of as well as the Biſhops, he would inſtead of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, declaim'd againſt the folly and madneſs of the Age, for want of juſtice) <hi>Licet non dictent judicia ſanguinis, eadem tamen tractant diſputando, &amp; diſceptando de illis, ſeque ideo immunes à culpà reputant, quod mortis aut truncationis membro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum judicium decernentes, à pronuntiatione duntaxat &amp; executione poenalis ſententiae ſe abſentent.</hi> And it is moſt obſervable, that the Biſhops did never
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56755:39"/> excuſe themſelves from Seſſion in Criminal Cauſes, by virtue of the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> but from the inhibition of the Canon; and the uſe of the Liberty will beſt declare the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it.</p>

               <p>IT's moſt remarkable for the underſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right the true meaning of this Law, that the Biſhops were admitted Judges in Parliament without exception of the Temporal Lords in the Caſe of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> accuſed of Treaſon, though the King and Temporal Barons had reaſon to believe, that the Biſhops would not do right to the Crown againſt that unruly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Prelate: and when the Biſhops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would have been glad of that pretence to have withdrawn themſelves. And this was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight Months after the making the Statutes of <hi>Clarendon;</hi> And in a ſhort time after the ſwearing the obſervance of them by all the <hi>Grants</hi> of the Kingdom. But the Law was then ſo well underſtood (however the Letter of the Statute makes matter of diſpute now) that it was by no body in the leaſt pretended, that it was to be underſtood to ſuch a ſence, as it is now drawn to: <hi>viz.</hi> to exclude the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56755:39"/> Biſhops the Spiritual Barons from judging in capital Cauſes in Parliament. In thoſe times they had only ſuch an underſtanding as we have here before offer'd.</p>
               <p>We ſhall therefore now proceed to give you an account how in the courſe of time the Right of the Prelates hath been uſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized. We will begin with the Caſe of <hi>Becket</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> at a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament held in <hi>October</hi> in the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 2. <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1165, at the Caſtle of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> To this Parliament Arch-Biſhop <hi>Becket</hi> was cited as a Criminal, and had not his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons as Arch-Biſhop (ſo that that Parliament ſeem'd to be conven'd for doing him Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; the offence muſt therefore be very great, ſo <hi>Stephanides</hi> tells us, as he is cited by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> 707.) Though he was wont of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to have the firſt Summons by the Kings Writ. <hi>Nec tunc enim</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nec diu ante ei ſcribere voluerat, qui eum ſalutare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebat. Nec aliam per literas ſibi directas ſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ac primam, ut antiquis moris erat, habuerat Archiepiſcopus ad Concilium citationem. Becket</hi> was there accuſed of Treaſon, <hi>laeſae majeſtatis coronae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Fitz-Stephen</hi> a Monk of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> that attended <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in his troubles. Biſhop <hi>Godwin</hi> in his Book <hi>de Praeſulibus</hi> tells us that Arch-Biſhop <hi>Becket, Omnia ſibi cernens infeſta, Naviculâ apud Rumenegam conſcenſâ, in Galliam profugere cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56755:40"/> ventis adverſantibus in littus repertus ac de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſus ad Regem, Conventus Northamptoniae agentem, adductus eſt. Ibi, repentundarum, peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atûs, perjurii, proditionis, falſi &amp; neſcio quot ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum Criminum, cum à caeteris proceribus tum &amp; Epiſcopis ipſis ſuffraganeis, reus factus.</hi> This Court is called a Parliament by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and <hi>magnum Concilium</hi> by <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Hoveden,</hi> and by others as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith; But that it was a Parliament and not the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> which we ſhall ſpeak about hereafter, doth appear by this certain diagnoſtick, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Biſhops were Summoned, hereto by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Writ of Summons to them directed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, at that time, which appears by what is before cited out of <hi>Fitz-Stephen,</hi> and what is after taken out of <hi>Gervaſius.</hi> But to the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> they were Summoned by the Sheriff by a general Writ, to him for that purpoſe directed, which is a diſtinctive Note and Character of a Parliament, as will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fitz-Stephen</hi> ſaith, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> quotes him, Titles of honour <hi>Fol.</hi> 705. that <hi>ſecunda die conſulentibus Epiſcopis &amp; Baronibus Angliae omnibus.</hi> Nay he is ſo exact in his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he tells us who was not there of the Biſhops, <hi>viz. Roffenſis Epiſcopus, &amp; quidam alias nondum venenat. Hoveden</hi> tells us, how <hi>Becket</hi> had before behaved himſelf towards the King, that notwithſtanding great endeavours
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56755:40"/> uſed on the Kings part, to reconcile <hi>Becket</hi> to himſelf, He would not be reconciled to the King. <hi>Poſt multum tempus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hoveden, Ernulphus Lexovienſis Epiſcopus venit in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliam, &amp; ſollicite laboravit die ac nocte, ut pax fieret inter Regem &amp; Archiepiſcopum, ſed ad ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num fieri non potuit. Deinde per conſilium Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovienſis Epiſcopi Rex ſeparavit Rogerum Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopum Eboracenſem, &amp; Robertum de Welun Epiſcopum Herefordienſem, &amp; Robertum Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnienſem Epiſcopum, &amp; alios quoſdam Eccleſiae Praelatos à Conſortio &amp; Conſilio Cantuarienſis Archiepiſcopi, ut per illos praefatum Cantuarien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem Archiepiſcopum in ſuos Conatus facilius alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret. Deinde venit in Angliam quidam vir Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioſus dictus Philippus de Eleemoſyna miſſus à latere Alexandri Summi Pontificis &amp; Cardina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium omnium ad pacem faciendam inter Regem &amp; Archiepiſcopum Cantuarienſem. Per quem ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Pontifex &amp; omnes Cardinales mandave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Cantuarienſi Epiſcopo, ut ipſe pacem cum domino ſuo Rege Angliae faceret, &amp; Leges ſuas ſine aliquâ exceptione cuſtodiendas promitteret: his igitur &amp; aliis magnorum virorum Conſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is acquieſcens, Thomas Cantuarienſis venit ad Regem apud Woodſtock, &amp; ibi promiſit Regi, &amp; conceſſit ſe bonâ fide &amp; ſine malo ingenio le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſuas ſervanturum. Et paulo poſt congregato Clero &amp; populo Regni apud Clarendon, poenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it Archiepiſcopum quod ipſe Conceſſionem illam fecerat Regi, &amp; volens reſilire à pacto, dixit
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56755:41"/> se in illa Conceſſione graviter peccaſſe, &amp; quod in hoc amplius non peccaret.

Tunc praecepit Rex univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis Comitibus &amp; Baronibus Regni, ut irent foras &amp; recordarentur Legum Henrici Regis Avi ſui, &amp; eas in ſcripto redigerent.

               </p>
               <p>If this was not an encroaching Royall power, there was never any ſuch fault, when he was grown ſo great that the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt ſupplicate; that the great men of that time, though paſſionataly interceding on the behalf of the King, could obtain no peace for the King. That an Ambaſſadour from the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56755:41"/> Pope and Cardinals muſt be ſent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to be reconciled to the King. That he did make a ſhew of being the Kings friend, and did promiſe to be at peace with the King and keep his Laws, at the Popes Command. But of this too he ſoon repented, and ſaid he would ſin no more. Was not this man a Traytor at Common Law before the 25 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. doth not the reaſon of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declare and pronounce him ſo? And doth the <hi>Octavo</hi> Author think that a Parliament would not uſe the declarative power by that Statute reſerved, to declare ſuch offences as theſe, Treaſon? If the like caſe ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, would not he himſelf be the likelyeſt man to be formoſt in the impeachment? But <hi>Gervaſius Dorobernenſis</hi> goes on and tells us, that afterwards <hi>Becket</hi> did voluntary pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for the aforeſaid promiſe made to the King, and of his ſubmiſſion to his Laws, and ſtood out in diſobedience. That the King did caſt about and ſtudy, <hi>quomodo vel qua ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te conſtantiam Archiepiſcopi conterere valeret, vel elidere virtutem,</hi> Col. 1388. But ſee in what reſpectful terms their Author in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſpeaks of this <hi>Becket.</hi> We may be ſure, we can have nothing from them, that is true, if it makes the Cauſe of this contumacious rebellious man bad. But at laſt the Kings pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is turned into Anger. For <hi>Gervaſius</hi> goes on <hi>Col.</hi> 1388. and ſaith, <hi>Timens autem
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56755:42"/> Rex Angliae, ne impune manus ejus Cantuarienſis Epiſcopus evaderet, jam edoctus multiplici Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitatione &amp; pravorum Eruditione quibus eum pravitatis laqueis innodaret, Praecepit Praeſules &amp; Proceres Regni, apud Northamptonian unà cum Archiepiſcopo ipſo convenire, qui cum tertia die conveniſſent, Archiepiſcopus in multis eſt accuſatus.</hi> And no man can believe his accuſation was leſs than Treaſon, that will believe what is ſaid by all Hiſtorians of <hi>Beckets</hi> Rebellious behaviour againſt the King, and the Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger conceived, his threatning him with death, and the convening of this Parliament, leſt he ſhould eſcape unpuniſht: And eſpecially that will obſerve the partiality of this <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſius</hi> againſt the King; and in favour of <hi>Beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et.</hi> For he ſaid, as is before obſerved and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that now the King was <hi>edoctus multiplici cogitatione,</hi> that now the King with much thought, and the Advice of wicked men was inſtructed how he might enſnare him with evil Arts, and for that purpoſe this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was convened. And yet in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar this <hi>Gervaſius</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Stephen,</hi> his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend who accompanied <hi>Becket</hi> in his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, mentions only two faults, whereof he is accuſed, <hi>viz.</hi> of injuſtice in the Caſe of <hi>John</hi> the Marſhall, and of his own Contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in not obeying the Kings Summons. <hi>Fitz-Stephen, Hoveden</hi> and <hi>Gervaſius</hi> tell us, that to the two particulars <hi>Becket</hi> made his defence.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56755:42"/> 
                  <hi>Gervaſius</hi> and <hi>Hoveden</hi> tells us what defence he made, which the <hi>Octavo</hi> hath faithfully tranſcribed, to do him right: (I wiſh he had obſerved the whole ſtory, then he would have ſaved me this trouble of bringing it into the view of the World.) The Article wherein he is charged, for not doing Juſtice to <hi>John Marſhall,</hi> is anſwered by laying the fault upon <hi>Marſhall</hi> himſelf, for abuſing the Court, bringing <hi>veterum Cantuum Codicillum,</hi> to ſwear upon, refuſing to ſwear <hi>ſub Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium, ut moris eſt.</hi> The other Article he anſwered, proving by two ſufficient Witneſſes, that it was ſickneſs hindred him and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny contempt; Very ſufficient Anſwers to thoſe two Articles, and certainly the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was called only for to puniſh <hi>Becket,</hi> might have well acquitted him and returned home, and a weighty cauſe this was to convene a Parliament.</p>
               <p>But theſe were but two of thoſe many things (for <hi>multis eſt accuſatus</hi> ſaith <hi>Gervaſius</hi>) and of the leaſt offence (beſides that they were fully anſwered) in any mans judgment that hath read the Story of <hi>Becket,</hi> of which he ſtood accuſed. By what I have here tranſcribed it appears, that he was certainly guilty of Treaſon. That the Parliament was called to puniſh him: The King was enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and that juſtly, and therefore he was moſt certainly accuſed of Treaſon. <hi>Gervaſius</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:56755:43"/> goes on and tells us, that <hi>his rationibus</hi> (meaning that he offered in excuſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the buſineſs of <hi>Marſhall</hi> and his own contempt) <hi>Archiepiſcous excuſari non potuit, ſed Curiali judicio, &amp; Aſſenſa Epiſcoporum condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus eſt, ita ut omnia ejus bona in miſericordia Regis ponerentur.</hi> And yet the proſecution went on. The Biſhops are conſulted with by <hi>Becket,</hi> how he ſhould behave himſelf. Thus <hi>Gervaſius</hi> tells us <hi>Coll.</hi> 1398. You may beſt underſtand the Nature of the proſecution and <hi>Beckets</hi> danger, by the advice of ſome of his Suffragan Biſhops. The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> thus adviſeth, <hi>Si pater, inquit, recolis, unde te Dominus Rex ſuſtulit, quid tibi contulit, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratâ temporum malitiâ, quam Ruinam Eccleſiae &amp; nobis omnibus paraveris, ſi in his Regi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtere volueris, non ſolum Archiepſcopatui Cantuariae, ſed in decuplo, ſi tanti fuerit, cedere deberes.</hi> Could all this danger grow from leſs than Treaſon? Could a bare neglect to anſwer a Summons, where he excuſed his default ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, or refuſing to proceed in the Caſe of <hi>Marſhall,</hi> for that he did preſumptuouſly trifle with the Court, and prophanely offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Sworn upon a Song-book, put the whole Church and himſelf in danger, big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be redeemed with ten times the value of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Becket</hi> not reſolved what to do, deſired of the Earls of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> that he might have time untill the morrow. And the morrow being <hi>Sunday,</hi> time was given until the <hi>Munday,</hi> and then the Biſhops came to <hi>Becket</hi> and adviſed him, for avoiding danger and ſcandal, to ſubmit himſelf to the Kings Will; which if he ſhould do, <hi>jam audierint in Curiâ Regis perjurii Crimen ſibi imponi, &amp; tanquam proditorem judicandum, eò quod terreno Domino honorem terrenum non ſervaret, cum avitas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudines

               <p>After <hi>Becket</hi> had given the Biſhops an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and reſolute Anſwer to adhere to his Treaſonable Practices, to diſallow the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King and States in the Laws called the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and to oppoſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of them; Obſerve what <hi>Gervaſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>diſceſſerunt Epiſcopi ad Curiam properan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> By and by <hi>Becket</hi> comes too (but the Biſhops were there before him) carrying the Croſs himſelf, which the King, as well as the Biſhops, took to be a coming armed. Upon which, ſaith <hi>Gervaſius, vocatis Epiſcopis &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceribus gravem &amp; grandem Rex deponit querimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam, quod Archiepiſcopus ſic armatus in Curiam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens ipſum &amp; ſuos omnes, inauditâ ſaeculis for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ, naevo notaverit proditoris.</hi> Whereupon the Biſhops by the Mouth of <hi>Hilaris Ciceſtrenſis</hi> a Biſhop more eloquent than the reſt, thus ſaid to <hi>Becket, Quandoque, ait, fuiſti Archiepiſcopus, &amp; tenebamur tibi obedire, ſed quia Domino Regi fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem juraſti, hoc eſt vitam, membra &amp; terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam dignitatem ſibi per te ſalvam fore, &amp; conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudines

               </p>
               <p>This I take to be a judging in Treaſon. But this the Biſhops did for their part, as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Suffragans they did withdraw their obedience from their Metropolitan, which was (as much as in them lay) to deprive him: a conviction it was of the Guilt, not indeed <hi>judicium ſanguinis.</hi> But this is not all; for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what our ſaid Author ſaith further, they going away, the King ſaith to them, <hi>diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te quid perjurus &amp; contumax proditor debeat ſuſtinere. Itur &amp; judicatur, &amp; à quo vel quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judicium pronuntiandum eſſet, informatur.</hi> In which matter <hi>Stephanides,</hi> as he is cited by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his Titles of Honour, in the <hi>Folio</hi> Edition <hi>fol.</hi> 705. tells us, how it was conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and debated between the Biſhops the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Barons, and the Temporal Barons, for ſaith he, <hi>de proferendo judicio diſtantia fuit inter E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopos &amp; Barones, utriſque alteri illud impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentibus, utriſque ſe excuſantibus.

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Judgment was pronounced, by whom, or what the Judgment was, is not certain, the Hiſtorians differing thereupon; But when he went out of the Court he was call'd by the people as he paſt, Traytor and perjured Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as the King before had called him.</p>
               <p>And if this be not the cleareſt proof of <hi>Beckets</hi> being accuſed of Treaſon, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops judging in a capital Cauſe in Parliament, there can be nothing proved to ſatisfaction: Beſides that all that writ of his ſtory are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing Witneſſes, they magnify, excuſe and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56755:45"/> juſtify the man all along, extolling his virtues. They call him Saint, <hi>Pater Patriae</hi> (ſo <hi>Gervaſius</hi> does <hi>Coll.</hi> 1393.) and Martyr.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader conſider what is here faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully recited, and then let him tell what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he hath of the Candor of the <hi>Octavo</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who could find no fault in <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> for he ſaith <hi>Folio</hi> 62. That <hi>Gervaſius Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernenſis</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Becket</hi> was charged with two things, Injuſtice to <hi>John Marſhall,</hi> and his own contempt in not appearing to the Kings Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: This Author had nothing of his own knowledge to charge upon him, and ſaith, that <hi>Stephanides</hi> is not to be regarded becauſe he was <hi>Beckets</hi> friend, and an obſcure <hi>Author,</hi> it may be not yet come into his Study.</p>
               <p>The Author had reaſon to ſee no faults in <hi>Becket,</hi> or to forget them all for the good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the inſolencies of that man hath done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Scandal of the Order. But we have not miſpent our own time, neither will the Reader regret our length in this matter, for this ſingle Caſe conſider'd, gives a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Queſtion; and puts the Right of the Biſhops to ſit in capital Cauſes out of all doubt. This Caſe will let in light for the true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it muſt be noted that the Great Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Clarendon</hi> was held by <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. about the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> in the tenth year of his Reign; the Biſhops and Lords were
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56755:46"/> all Sworn to obſerve the Statutes there made (called the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi>) called the <hi>Avitae conſuetudines Regni,</hi> of which the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned was one.</p>
               <p>This Law therefore muſt be interpreted in ſuch a ſenſe, for that the words will bear it, and can be intended in no other than that which may conſiſt with the proceedings in the Caſe of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Becket,</hi> and with the Oaths of all the Biſhops and Peers, and the great men, taken but a ſhort time before, to obſerve the Statutes of <hi>Clarendon:</hi> Now if the whole Order of capital Cauſes had been intended to be excepted by that Statute above recited (upon which our Adverſaries do ſo much ground themſelves) from the Cogniſance of the Lords Spiritual, and they could not be preſent when any ſuch Caſe was agitated or moved, all the Grandees were Notoriouſly, Willfully, and Knowingly, and in the face of the whole World perjured to the Eternal infamy of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Could the whole Nation be ignorant of its own Laws and Conſtitutions, made and ſworn to but a few months before? and neither the King, Lords Spiritual or Temporal, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons underſtand them? 120 men at leaſt, (for about that number were the Biſhops and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Barons in <hi>H.</hi> the 2ds. time and not leſs) now come into the higheſt Judicature in the greateſt Cauſe that ever was agitated (It was
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56755:46"/> in the Caſe of <hi>Becket</hi> diſputed whether we ſhould have a Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) and there ſit Judges, and no body except againſt them in <hi>October,</hi> if excluded by the Statute made in <hi>February</hi> before; though the King and the Nobles had reaſon to ſuſpect them on <hi>Becket's</hi> ſide, and they unwilling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Judge, and they under an Oath not to ſit, and the Temporal Lords under an Oath not to admit them or allow them to be there? And yet not a word of this matter in all the Hiſtorians of that time, <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his friends to a man, who were forward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reproach the Judges ſure, when they condemned the Sentence, and applauded the Criminal, and made a <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> a Martyr and Saint of this Notorious Church Rebel. He therefore that can believe that the Biſhops were not rightful and unexceptionable Judges in capital Cauſes in Parliament, in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 2. may believe that a whole Nation may become of inſane Memory at once, go to bed a Monarchy and wake into a Common-wealth, without any notice or obſervation of a Change. And now that the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi> is of our ſide, I hope will be admitted, and that the Biſhops not only may, but ought to be preſent in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Cauſes in Parliament, for the words of the Statutes are; That the <hi>Archiepiſcopi, Epiſcopi &amp; univerſi perſonae qui de Rege tenent in Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, habeant poſſeſſiones ſuas de Rege ſicut Baroniam,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56755:47"/> &amp; ſicut caeteri Barones debent intereſſe Judiciis Curiae Domini Regis cum Baronibus.</hi> So that now they were declared to be Judges as the other Barons, in that they ought to be preſent in all Cauſes: Only they were favoured ſo much in decent regard to their Order, that they were not required to be preſent at the Sentence of Death and multilation of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for as much as they are the Miniſters of Gods pardon, and the Publiſhers of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith and Repentance; they ought to comport with their office, and expreſs their Commiſeration to the greateſt Sinner, and to have ſome reluctancy againſt the Sentence of Condemnation, and to that purpoſe is that Indulgence given them in the <hi>quouſque perveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur ad mutilationem membrorum vel mortem.</hi> But the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi> having; I will not ſay left them, but required them to be Judges (this exception of <hi>Quouſque</hi> &amp;c. being only an Indulgence as aforeſaid upon the Reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) they remain entire Judges in Capital Cauſes, and may depart from that Indulgence, and ought ſo to do when Juſtice is neceſſary, and the offences more than ordinarily Publick, and will be pardoned and eſcape with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the hazard of the Government, except they interpoſe. For if the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi> had not left them entire Judges of Right, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at liberty as to the pronouncing of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; they had not remain'd Judges; for the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56755:47"/> office of a Judge cannot be divided; he that hath not an Authority to judge the Cauſe, can be reckoned and accounted no other than a miniſterial aſſiſtant to the proceſs, in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as the Court ſhall award. Therefore Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; in that they have intermedled as Judges in ſuch Cauſes, they have continued and avowed their Right of judging, and in that they have withdrawn at the Sentence they have uſed that Liberty. But to leave nothing for an after ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, Evaſion, or Cavillation, it ſhall be in our Adverſary's choice, Whether this <hi>Curia Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> as alſo the Court that tryed <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> was the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> wherein the ordinary Juſtice of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was at that time adminiſtred, or the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>If it was the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> and not the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, was intended in the <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> of <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in which the Priviledge and Indulgence under the <hi>Quouſque</hi> was allowed to Biſhops; Then the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi> is unduly urged againſt the Biſhops judging in Caſes of blood in Parliament, for that all Laws of Priviledge and exemption are <hi>ſtricti Juris,</hi> and not to be extended beyond the Letter of the Law, the ſingle inſtance, or the enumerated Caſes; and conſequently by the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have no leave to withdraw in Caſes of blood in Parliament.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:56755:48"/>
               <p>If the Court wherein <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> was tryed was the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> then the Biſhops judging in that Court in that Cauſe doth moſt clearly declare (that being a Caſe in point) that the <hi>quouſque</hi> in the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi> was an Indulgence and Priviledge, which they might uſe or wave as they then did.</p>
               <p>But this cannot be denyed, that the Biſhops are and were Barons ever ſince the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, (of which, and of the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> we ſhall hereafter give an account) and whatever was the buſineſs and office of Baron, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the office and buſineſs of a Biſhop of Common Right, and ſtill is, except any Legal reſtraint was put upon them by any Law, which was not done by the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> as we have proved by the reaſon of the making of that Law, the Interpretation of that Law at that time. Nor was that Law or any other Law hitherto pretended (but only the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church) againſt the Right and Duty of Biſhops in Capital Cauſes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or if they will have it, in the <hi>Curia Regis.</hi>

That before the arrival of <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt in <hi>England</hi> who had been in Captivity in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that one <hi>Adam de</hi> St. <hi>Edmond,</hi> Agent to <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> returned into <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent to fortifie the Caſtle of Earl <hi>John,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King his Brother, and was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> with ſeveral papers of inſtructions and Commiſſions of Earl <hi>Johns</hi> for that purpoſe: <hi>Hoveden</hi> tells us, That the Mayor <hi>cepit omnia brevia ſua, in quibus mandata Comitis Johannis continebantur, &amp; tradidit ea Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarienſi Epiſcopo, qui in craſtino convocatis coram eo Epiſcopis, Comitibus &amp; Baronibus Regni, oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit eis literas Comitis Johannis &amp; earum tenorem, &amp; ſtatim per commune Concilium Regni definitum eſt, quod Comes Johannes diſſeiſeretur de omnibus Tenementis ſuis in Anglia, &amp; Caſtella ſua obſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Cauſe of Treaſon, for that <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt immediately upon the demiſe of the Crown was King. It can be no objection that this was not a formal Parliament, for whether it was or no, it ſeems the Biſhops power in that Cauſe was allowed. That it was <hi>Commune Concilium Regni,</hi> and had the Nature of a Parliament. And that the Biſhops therein had a parity of Authority with the Temporal Lords. But ſoon after his return King <hi>Richard</hi> held a Parliament at <hi>Notingham Hoveden</hi> mentions the Biſhops that were preſent

               </p>
               <p>You ſee here the Biſhops zeal and Loyalty, that they adjoyn'd the cenſure of the Church which they had power of as Biſhops, to a Civil puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they with the Temporal Barons had Authority to pronounce againſt One of their own Order, who was guilty of a deſign to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a Nation in a War by oppoſing the lawful Succeſſour to the Crown; and this being ſo great a Cauſe, We hear nothing here of any ſcruple the Canon gave them, nor mention of any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of an Eccleſiaſtick to be exempt from the Judgment of the ſecular Court.</p>

And ſo far did that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prevail, that the preſence of the Lords Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al was neceſſary to give Authority to a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Houſe, that for this Cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prelates were abſent, that Judgment was reverſed.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56755:50"/> Right in the Reverſal remains an undeniable Teſtimony to their Right of ſitting: Tho' the Reverſal of that Judgment was not warrantable, for the reaſon of the Biſhops abſence, as it could not have been reverſed by reaſon of the abſence of as many Temporal Barons if there remained e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough beſides to make a Houſe to give the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And yet we find the Reverſal of the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal reverſed in 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and the Family of the <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> reſtored in the perſon of the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> So prevalent was the opinion that the Biſhops Concurrence was neceſſary in all capital Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Parliament at that time. For this ſee Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Abridgment, <hi>fol.</hi> 373.</p>
               <p>Yet it is obſervable that the conſequence from the Biſhops being a third State, and an Eſſential conſtituent part of that Houſe; to a neceſſity of their preſence in all judicial matters, even of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Offences and Treaſon, did ſo ſtick with that Age: for they then in that Age did no more know what three States ſerved for, or that they both made but one Houſe, than ſome in our time can tell how to find them.</p>
               <p>For that very Reaſon in 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. the firſt Petition that the Commons made in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to the King was, for that diverſe Judgments were heretofore undone, for that the Clergy were not preſent. The Commons prayed the King that the Clergy would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſome to be their Common Proctor with ſufficient Authority thereunto.

               <p>This the adverſaries of the Biſhops would have an Act of Parliament, for that at the prayer of the Biſhops by the Kings command, with the aſſent of the Lords Temporal and Commons, it was inrolled; for that all the formalities that were uſed in theſe times, in paſſing a Law, was only to have the matter ſhortly entred in the Roll, or Journal Book, that ſuch a thing was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the King and two Houſes, which was drawn into the form of a Law afterwards by the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Kings Councel when the Parliament was riſen; but this was never done in this Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore we might ſay that it is not to be taken for a Law.</p>
               <p>But we will admit it to be a Law, yet it can be a Law only for that Caſe, and can be extended no further: Thoſe Biſhops proteſt; but for whom? For themſelves only, their own perſons, not their ſucceſſors; that by reaſon of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56755:53"/> of the Canon they could not be preſent at certain matters to be treated of in the Parliament. What thoſe Canons were they do not tell us. They had no other reaſon but the Canon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at that time. We hear not a word from them of the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon:</hi> And what was it that they proteſted? Why only that they could not be preſent: at what? only at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters aforeſaid mentioned in the Petition and in that preſent Parliament. But was this without any regard of their Right? No, they ſaved their Right, their <hi>Jus Paritatis:</hi> pray mark it: what then did they in effect depart from? nothing. They provided only that they might do nothing indecent or rather againſt their good liking, and at the ſame time conſulted likewiſe the ſafety of their Eſtate and Order, and preſervation of all their Rights.</p>
               <p>But had they no care of the Authority of the Parliament in their abſence? yes, for they very well knew that it was a probable opinion that nothing acted in their abſence and during a receſs of their whole Order could be rate and valid; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they provide <hi>propter hujuſmodi abſentiam non intendimus nec volumus, nec eorum aliquis intendit vel vult, quod proceſſus habiti &amp; habendi in praeſenti Parliamento ſuper materiis auditis, quantum ad nos &amp; eorum quemlibet attinet, futuris temporibus quomodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet impugnentur, infirmentur ſeu etiam revocentur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Impartial Reader Judge whether this be not a famous recognition of the Biſhops Right of ſitting, what a ſolemn leave they had to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56755:53"/> what proviſions made that the proceedings in that Parliament ſhould not be avoided and made null by their abſence; which implies a great probability, that that time allowed to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their being neceſſary in all proceedings in Parliament. Was there ever ſuch a proteſtation entred on the behalf of the Abſentees of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Barons? This leave given them to be abſent is an allowance of Right to ſit. The proceedings they liked not and the Canon was pretended. Admitting this proteſtation to be an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, It is an Act of Parliament to give the Biſhops leave to be abſent <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> and to make Laws good that ſhould paſs in their abſence. I appeal to the world whether there can be a more Solemn and Authentick Recognition of their Right than this proteſtation imports.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>IT does appear by the whole tenor of this their proteſtation, that the Canons of the Church which they pretend had not paſſed into Laws; if they had, what need of ſuch a warm proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, only for the ſake of <hi>decency</hi> and the <hi>honeſty of their order,</hi> to be rid of a troubleſome buſineſs? what means the ſaving of their right, if by Law it had been diſcharged? what means their further proteſtation that the validity of the proceedings in thoſe Cauſes in which they withdrew, ſhould
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56755:54"/> not be impeach't by their abſence, if their Right did not remain entire notwithſtanding the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non? beſides that they do not alledge the Law but the Canons of the Church for their excuſe.</p>
               <p>They well knew the nature of Canons, the force and obligation of them, and alſo that they were not under any obligation to the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> that it was only a Law in the Popes Temporal principality, and had no Controul upon the Laws of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>For the clearing this queſtion it will not be unneceſſary here to ſpeak to the nature of Canons, what they effect and how oblige.</p>
               <p>Canons therefore are no more Laws than the authority of the Church is Empire, no not in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are proper for their Canons. But moſt certainly they can neither make nor annul a Civil Right, nor do they pretend to alter or change Governments: they exceed their proper bounds when they intermeddle in any matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But when they do extend themſelves beyond their bounds and order, and appoint in any matter of a Civil Government; they intend only to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and direct the man how he ſhall behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the uſe of his Right, which every man may obſerve if he pleaſe. Their Subjects are <hi>Populus voluntarius,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical Courts are Courts of <hi>audience</hi> in matters that belong to their cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, and the Church's word is, <hi>He that will hear let him hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Canons of foreign Councils tho' General, tho' we ſend thither our Delegates and Proxies
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56755:54"/> authorized by publick Inſtruments, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Parliament, as has been ſometimes done, have not the conſideration of Canons, except re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived here and allowed by the ſame Authority, that makes the Canons of our Church.</p>
               <p>Canons here muſt have the Royal aſſent at leaſt to make them Canons, but with the Kings aſſent they are void, if they alter or meddle with any Civil Right or Conſtitution. If any man is proceeded againſt in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts for being contrary in any thing to ſuch a Canon, our Courts will grant him a prohibition; if Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate thereupon, award Writs to aſſoil him to the Biſhop, and ſeiſe his Temporalties if he do not conform.</p>
               <p>Nothing can alter Civil Rights or Civil Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions but <hi>Law,</hi> and ſuch never were any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons or ſo reputed; except the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils confirmed by the Imperial Reſcripts of the Roman Emperors, who by their Reſcripts made Laws by the Authority of the <hi>Lex regia,</hi> by which the people devolved their Right of Legiſlation to the Emperors: but when ſuch Canons were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Emperor, they remained but Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons ſtill, the Canons were to be exacted by the meaſures of the Church and by the Church-men, the matters of ſuch Canons did not employ the <hi>Forum;</hi> no alteration was made in any Civil Right, but the Church had Authority to require obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of them, under the Cenſures of the Church.</p>
               <p>About the 11th. Century the Pope meditating the increaſe of his new Eccleſiaſtical Empire,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56755:55"/> (the Roman Empire being now extinct) did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to give Laws to the World: and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in imitation of the Imperial Roman Law, <hi>Gratian</hi> was appointed to compile a body of Laws accomodated to that deſign, out of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, the ſayings of the Fathers, and ſome decrees of former Popes, which made that part of the Canon Law which they call the <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> to anſwer to the Digeſt which was made up of the <hi>Senatus conſulta, Reſponſa prudentum</hi> and the <hi>Edicta Praetorum;</hi> to which another Book was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Decretals</hi> and <hi>Clementines,</hi> made up of the Popes <hi>Decretal Epiſtles,</hi> which anſwered to the <hi>Codes</hi> and <hi>Novels</hi> which was made up of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, Epiſtles and Decrees of the Emperors: For by the Conſtitution of the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> by which they gave the power of making Laws to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> it was eſtabliſhed, that <hi>quicquid per Epiſtolam ſtatuit, cognoſcens decrevit, aut per edictum propalavit, lex eſto.</hi> And now there was ſuch a thing as a body of <hi>Canon Law.</hi> The Pope had Power indeed to make theſe <hi>Decreta</hi> and <hi>Decretalia</hi> Laws in the <hi>Domains</hi> of the Church and the patrimony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in which he was a Temporal Prince; but it was further endeavoured by him to make them the Laws of the Chriſtian World, and thereby to advance his pretended Oecumencial Empire, and he did ſo far prevail and advance in his deſign, that it was thought that <hi>Rome</hi> had again recovered the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the World, and it was ſaid with too much truth of her upon the growth of the Papal power,

               <p>But tho' the Pontificial as well as the <hi>Juſtinian Law</hi> was publickly profeſſed in <hi>England</hi> before the end of the 12th. Century, for <hi>Mat. Paris</hi> tells us of a Monk of <hi>Eveſham, Anno Dom.</hi> 1196. that <hi>ſuo tempore eorum quos Decretiſtas &amp; Legiſtas appellant peritiſſimus habebatur, earum etiam facultatum audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores quamplurimos inſtituerat,</hi> and from that time the ſtudy of the <hi>Caeſarean</hi> and <hi>Pontificial Law</hi> did flouriſh amongſt us, until the beginning of <hi>E.</hi> 3. But in all that time ſaith Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> in his <hi>Fleta, gens ipſa Anglicana ac qui in judiciis praeerant, morum patriorum</hi> (viz.) <hi>Juris Communis Angliae per inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallum illud tenaciſſimi fuere.</hi> A remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we have of this Nations ſteady averſion from admitting here either the Civil or Canon Law in the Parliament of <hi>Merton,</hi> which rejected a Bill for Legitimation of Children born before marriage in Concubinate, in theſe Terms: <hi>Nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus leges Angliae mutari,</hi> meaning that they would not make Laws conformable to the Civil or Canon Law.</p>
               <p>The great Policy that the Popes uſed to effect their Ambitious deſign of making themſelves Monarchs of the Chriſtian World were: The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to themſelves the entire rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion, and endeavouring to make every where the Biſhops and the whole Clergy, together with the Regulars, dependant upon them by pretending them to be exempt from all Civil
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56755:56"/> Authority and Juriſdiction: and by interdicting to them the exerciſe of any Civil Authority, and ſhutting them out from all intromiſſions into the Civil Government, and from any intereſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance thereupon: So far as he prevailed in theſe deſigns, he acquired an <hi>Imperium in Imperio;</hi> and if beſides theſe he could have fixt a Spiritual handle to the Temporal Sword, and have got the Government of ſecular affairs <hi>in ordine ad ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualia,</hi> his deſign had been compleated, and he had arrived to a more abſolute and extenſive Empire than that of the <hi>Roman Caeſars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe purpoſes the Canon Law provided that the Eccleſiaſticks were neither to exerciſe, nor be ſubject to any Civil Authority: But this policy of the Pope had no ſucceſs in <hi>England,</hi> the endeavours of the <hi>Papalins</hi> herein met with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant oppoſition: and at laſt they were made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate by the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> where it was declared and enacted accordingly agreeable to the <hi>Avitae Conſuetudines Regni,</hi> that the Biſhops ſhould be retained and continue to be a part of the Government, and exerciſe Juriſdiction in all Cauſes in the Kings Court as other Barons, as is before obſerved, and that the Clergy ſhould ſtand ſubmitted to the Juriſdiction of the Kings Courts. For this purpoſe it was alſo in that Parliament enacted as followeth: <hi>Si controverſia emerſerit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Laicos vel Laicos &amp; Clericos, in Curia Domini Regis tractetur &amp; determinetur,</hi> and alſo <hi>quod clerici rectati &amp; accuſati de quacunque re ſummoniti à Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Regis venient in Curiam Domini Regis reſponſuri ibidem,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:56755:56"/>
               <p>And ſo far were the Biſhops and Clergy from obſerving that part of the Canon Law that was to detrude them from all ſecular Authority and Juriſdiction, that they were from time to time Chancellors, Treaſurers, Keepers of the Privy Seal and Judges, and while that Ancient Office continued of <hi>Capitalis Juſticiarius Angliae,</hi> to whom was committed the Juſtice of the Kingdom, (who were called <hi>Cuſtodes Regni, Vice-Domini Angliae,</hi> and ſometimes the abſtract <hi>Juſtitia,</hi> He did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> which Office was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards divided, for there were <hi>Juſtitiarii Angliae Boreales, &amp; Juſtitiarii Angliae Auſtrales,</hi>) this Office was often executed by Biſhops as you may ſee in Sir <hi>Hen. Spelmans Gloſſary,</hi> in the word <hi>Juſtitiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> Biſhops and Church-men adminiſtred the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Offices of State and Juſtice: this was matter of Envy to the Temporal Lords, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in Parliament 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3. (as is before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,) That the Government of the Kingdom had been a long time in the hand of the Clergy. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Fleta</hi> tells us, that in the times before and after the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon, Mos fuit Judices Regios ex genere hieratico, veluti Epiſcopis, Abbatibus, Decanis, id genus aliis, conſtituendi.</hi> And it is provided by 28 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. That if a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was a Judge of Aſſiſe, another ſhould be joyned in Commiſſion with him to deliver the Goals; which was to the end that the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Judge might uſe that liberty which was indulged to him by the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi> of not pronouncing the Sentence; for it muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56755:57"/> that by that Statute a Clergy-man might be a Judge in a Goal-delivery; for that a Laick was by the proviſion of that Statute to be join'd to him in Commiſſion, and Pleas of the Crown are to be found, purporting them to be held before two Judges, whereof one a Clerk, after this Law, which could not poſſibly have been if the Clerk had not been in Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Beſides for after Ages it is well known that all the great Officers and Miniſters of State and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice have been always intruſted with the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancy of the peace, are in Commiſſions of the peace, and Commiſſioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> for judging capital Cauſes; ſo that the conſtant practice in all times, as well as the expreſs decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Aſſiſe of <hi>Clarendon</hi> doth aſſure us that the Canon Law that prohibits Clergy-men being Judges in capital Cauſes, was never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved here or became the common Law of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Beſides what regard our Clergy had of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, what opinion they had of the Right in queſtion, and how far the Laws did intend to prohibit the exerciſe of it; And that ſuch right was uſed and exerciſed, will appear by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of <hi>Toledo, Concil. Toletan.</hi> 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>fo.</hi> 553. and the Canon of <hi>Lanfrank, Spelmans Concil.</hi> 2 <hi>vol. fol.</hi> 11. theſe were made before the Aſſiſe of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon.</hi> That of <hi>Toledo</hi> is this. <hi>His à quibus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Sacramenta tractanda ſunt, judicium ſanguinis agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare non licet, &amp; ideo magnopere talium exceſſibus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibendum eſt, ne qui praeſumptionis motibus agitati aut quod morte plectendum eſt, ſententia propria judicandi
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56755:57"/> mant, aut truncationes quaſlibet membrorum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſlibet perſonis, aut per ſe inferant aut inferendas precipiant.</hi> This being a Foreign Council, this Canon carries not with it the Authority of a Canon with us; only we may obſerve, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Opinion of that Council was that it was not convenient (for <hi>licet</hi> can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſence here) for Clergy-men <hi>agitare judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Sanguinis:</hi> Yet this Canon prohibits only the pronouncing the Sentence by themſelves or others. I am ſure, that by a poſitive Law, as this Canon muſt be, ſo far as it participates of the nature of a Law, nothing becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, but what is forbidden, whatever the reaſon be of that Prohibition. That of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frank</hi> follows thus; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nullus Epiſcopus, vel Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, ſeu quilibet ex Clero hominem occidendum, vel membris truncandam judicet, vel judicantibus ſuae authoritatis favorem accomodet.</hi> This may be a Canon for all that I know; but I ſuſpect, it had never the Royal Aſſent to make it ſo, it not being likely, that the Conqueror would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Biſhops from thoſe Services of the Crown, which he had ſo lately obliged them to, by his tenure; but ſurely it was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by this Canon, that the Prelates, and great Abbots ſhould, or that they did depart from their Royal Franchiſes, and not make their Officers for adminiſtring Juſtice according to their Authorities in their Charters of Liberties and Priviledges: For the words of the Canon, <hi>Vel
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56755:58"/> judicantibus tuae authoritatis favorem accomodet;</hi> if they ſignifie any thing more than what weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low muſt ſound to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But I ſuppoſe the Gentlemen that appear'd againſt the Biſhops, had rather than affirm ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the known practice of all Ages, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to agree, that this Canon did only intend to prohibit their pronouncing, or encouraging, or promoting the Sentence of Death, or Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and indeed this was all that truly could be pretended to, from them, in comporting themſelves decently with reſpect (as the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe times was) to their Function: which is expreſſed to be the Inducement to that Canon of <hi>Toledo,</hi> as it was the only avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reaſon of all others, that is, that it did not become (as they thought) thoſe that admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the Sacraments, which were the Seals of God's Pardon, to pronounce an exterminating Sentence of Life and Member, though they might have a farther Secret purpoſe therein, of carrying on the Deſign of a Church-Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by imbodying the Clergy, and dividing them from all Secular Dependencies; but this was nor always to be owned; neither is it an agreable Employment to any perſon who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends himſelf a Proteſtant, to urge theſe ill-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Canons, as a pretence to diveſt the Biſhops of thoſe their Legal Rights which were ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the high Growth of the Papal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, upon any pretence whatſoever; or to go
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56755:58"/> about to deprave the Reformation, as if the true Chriſtian Religion would not allow to the Biſhops, Honors and Truſts as great as they now enjoy by the Conſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who are the Chief Miniſters of it: which is a Religion that makes men wiſe and good, the Religion of the State, and is the greateſt Support of it, and reciprocally this Religion it ſelf, is honored, aſſiſted, and greatly advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for obtaining its ends by thoſe Honors, and the place at preſent appointed to them in the Government. But it is deplorable to find any man ſo madly ſet upon ſo bad a Deſign, that he ſhould be thereby tranſported from Common Sence, and think to diſplace them, and degrade them by Popiſh Canons, that when they were made, did not oblige, were never obſerved, and can no more bind our preſent Church to obſerve them, than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Toledo,</hi> or <hi>Lanfrank,</hi> and his <hi>Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> and Clerks, can be blam'd for not being agreable to the Canons that have been made ſince the Reformation, or hereafter ſhall be made by our Church, in any after Age of the World. But there are two Canons yet behind, which have been mentioned in this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which we will likewiſe take notice of; or we ſhall have ſaid nothing; though I almoſt deſpair, that any thing will be a Satisfaction to ſuch Oppoſers as this Right hath met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:56755:59"/>
               <p>The firſt whereof was made by <hi>Richard,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, Anno Domini</hi> 1175. in 21 <hi>H.</hi> 2. about Eleven Years after the Aſſize of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> in theſe Words, as <hi>Hoveden,</hi> p. 310. <hi>ac Gervaſe Dorob.</hi> relates them, <hi>His qui in ſacris Ordinibus conſtituti ſunt judicium ſanguinis agitare non licet; unde prohibemus ne aut per ſe membrorum truncationes faciant, aut inferendas judicent: quod ſi quis tale fecerit conceſſi Ordinis privetur officio &amp; loco; inhibemus etiam ſub interminatione Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematis, ne quis Sacerdos habeat Vicecomitum, aut praepoſiti ſecularis officium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other was made <hi>Anno</hi> 1222, about 47 years after the firſt, which is to be found in <hi>Linwood,</hi> p. 146. among the Conſtitutions of <hi>Stephen,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as follows, <hi>Praeſenti Decreto ſtatuimus ne Clerici beneficiati aut in ſacris ordinibus conſtituti villarum procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratores admittantur, viz. ut ſint Seneſchalli aut Ballivi talium adminiſtrationum; occaſione quarum laicis in reddendis ratiociniis obligentur: veljuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiones exerceant ſeculares, preſertim illas quibus ſanguinis judicium in locis ſacris tractetur, in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, viz. aut in Coemiterio. Authoritate quoque Concilii diſtrictiùs inhibemus ne quis Clericus bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiatus vel in Sacris Ordinibus conſtitutus literas pro poena ſanguinis infligenda ſcribere vel dictare preſumat, vel ubi judicium ſanguinis tractatur vel exercetur interſit. Noverint enim hujuſmodi ſe Eccleſiaſtica indignos protectione cum per eos in Eccleſia Dei per talia preſumpta ſcandalum generetur.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56755:59"/>
               <p>Upon both theſe Canons, we obſerve, firſt, that the Pope's Canon-Law had not obtained in <hi>England:</hi> For then there had been no need of theſe Canons; or however their Denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cenſures would have been the ſame: That the Inhibition is repeated by a Second Council, but in milder Terms, ſignifies to me the Continuance of the thing prohibited; and that it was ſo much in uſe after the firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, that the ſecond Council thought fit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to direct and admoniſh by their Canon, than to pronounce either <hi>Anathema</hi>'s, or Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt thoſe that break that Canon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That neither of theſe Canons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Biſhops; not the firſt, not only for that I queſtion whether Biſhops can be intended in ſuch general words, <hi>In Sacris Ordinibus conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuti:</hi> But becauſe the Denunciation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non cannot have effect as to them, no Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Authority can depoſe a Metropolitan; and alſo becauſe the Second cannot, by any Conſtruction extend to them; for <hi>Clerici benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciali,</hi> does not mean them; and that which comes after, <hi>aut in Sacris Ordinibus conſtituti,</hi> cannot aſcend in meaning, and intend the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, eſpecially in a Canon Law, which we muſt ſuppoſe penn'd with ſpecial Care and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, of Decency and Reverence to that Order.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:56755:60"/>
               <p>Now, to conſider them apart, I find the firſt agreable to, and to prohibit no more than what the Biſhops (if here meant) are licenced and priviledged from in the Aſſize of <hi>Clarendon:</hi> And to intend more, is unreaſonable, when it was made in time ſo near to <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Becket,</hi> that his Fate could not be forgotten. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we muſt diſtinguiſh between the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which contains the Reaſon and Inducement of a Law, and what is for that reaſon prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; For let the Reaſon be as large as it will, yet the Law is no other than what is enjoyned. Reaſon makes no Law, but the Legiſlators for Reaſons which they may tell us if they pleaſe; though the Nature of Canons requires, that they ſhould. The Preamble of this Canon, was an opinion taken up amongſt ſome of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, <hi>viz, Non licet his, qui in ſacris ordinibus conſtituti judicium ſanguinis agitare unde:</hi> (ſaith the Canon) <hi>Prolibemus ne aut per ſe membrorum truncationes faciant,</hi> (a very fitting Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a Biſhop) <hi>aut inferendas judicent;</hi> and after all this, we have ſtill our old Anſwer, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we will ever inſiſt; it is but a Canon, and can make no Alteration in the Rights of Government.</p>
               <p>For tho' <hi>Gervaſius Dorob.</hi> tells us, <hi>In hoc Concilio, ad emendationem Anglicanae Eccleſiae aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſu Domini Regis, &amp; primorum omnium Regni haec ſubſcripta promulgata ſunt Capitula;</hi> yet the Canons of this Council are not Laws: For that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56755:60"/> our Hiſtorian does not tell us of any Parliament then held, or that they were confirmed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the good liking of Great Men out of Parliament, will not confirm; nay, not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Canons, if they cannot juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Parliament. Beſides, that theſe Canons were not made into Laws, we will offer two Reaſons. 1ſt. For that amongſt theſe Canons, there is one that diſpoſeth of the Right of Patronage againſt the Law, as it hath been before and ſince taken; and that is this, <hi>Nulli liceat Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam nomine dotalitii ad aliquem transferre, vel pro preſentatatione alicui perſonae pecuniam vel ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod emolumentum pacto interveniente recipere: quod ſi quis fecerit &amp; in jure convictus vel confeſſus fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ipſum tam Regia, quam noſtra freti autoritate patricinio ejuſdem Eccleſiae in perpetuum privari ſtatuimus;</hi> which was never, moſt certainly Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If this had been a Law, the other Canon before-mentioned, made by <hi>Stephen,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was idle; nay, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, for offering to derogate from a Canon, made a Law about 47 years before: But however, Canons confirmed by Law, remain but Canons ſtill; and the Breach of them not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as the Breach of Laws, nor no Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made thereby, upon a civil Right; of which before and after more.</p>
               <p>As to the Second Canon, we obſerve how dutiful this Canon in the Stile of it behaves it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56755:61"/> ſelf towards the Civil Government, in that Clerks ſhould not exerciſe Juriſdiction where Judgment of Blood is to be given, under the ſoft word <hi>Statuimus,</hi> that they ſhould not <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teras pro poena ſanguinis infligenda ſcribere,</hi> that is, ſign an Order for the Execution of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Man, or be preſent at the Sentence, is under the <hi>diſtrictiùs inhibemus;</hi> but the doing of this, is not declared to be a Sin; he that is contravenient to the Canon, is not thereby to become irregular to be puniſhed by his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, or to incurr Excommunication, or any Cenſure, the Clergy are not declared by this Canon to be incompetent Judges: it only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares them unworthy of the Protection of the Church; the meaning of it is, <hi>Judge not leaſt ye be judged:</hi> If you judge the <hi>Laicks,</hi> they will judge you. This is the Scandal for which the <hi>Privilegium Clericale</hi> will be loſt; So that upon the whole matter this Canon is but Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Counſel, and offers reaſons to the Choice and Approbation, rather than a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, under the Authority of the Church in a Council. But let it be what it will, if the Canon had been moſt peremptory in its Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and had lighten'd and thunder'd in its Denunciatiations, it would have been of no force to alter the Government, or diſcharge a Judge from doing his Duty; but this is farther to be duely obſerved, that this Canon could not be broken if the Law had not been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56755:61"/> than theſe Canons direct; and therefore theſe Canons produced by our Adverſaries, are the greateſt Teſtimonies to the Right we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and a practice agreeable thereto. Doth not the Canon ſuppoſe, that a Beneficed Clerk, or one in Holy Orders, was ſometimes in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for judging in Capital Cauſes? For certainly the Canon did not prohibit them to murder, or enjoyn them not to write Letters to ſubborn men to kill. What can be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Canon but this, ſuppoſing a Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Clerk to be made a Judge of Life and Death, to aſſiſt in a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer &amp; Terminer,</hi> or Goal-delivery, that he ſhould be enjoyned not to pronounce the Sentence, or to ſign the Order or Calendar for Execution. But if he were not a Judge, how poſſibly could he ſign an Order for Execution? By the other words of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>Nec interſit ubi judicium ſanguinis tractatur;</hi> he can be forbidden onely to be preſent and aſſiſting as a Judge or Officer at the pronouncing of Sentence: for it can be no fault ſure, nor ever was intended by any Canon to be made one, for any Clerk to hear a Court pronounce a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Death or Mutilation, or to ſee a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor executed.</p>
               <p>What therefore can be more evident, than that the Biſhops did withdraw, not for want of Right of Seſſion, but they pretended the Canon becauſe they did not like the Cauſes? But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that nothing more than what we have
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56755:62"/> ſhewed was underſtood to be done in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, by thoſe times (they muſt be allowed at leaſt to know their own Opinions) doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for that notwithſtanding the Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Biſhops aforementioned, the great Council of the Kingdom did not think the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Parliament when the Biſhops were abſent unqueſtionable. This Opinion we do not go about to maintain, but this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there could never have been ſuch an Opinion, if the Biſhops had been denied Right of Seſſion in Capital Cauſes in that time.</p>

               <p>THE Commons of <hi>England</hi> in the 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2 pray, that the Biſhops might make their Proxy; which they did thrice in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, once by Procuratory Letters to Sir <hi>Thomas Percy,</hi> as is before recited; and afterwards <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam la Scroop</hi> Earl of <hi>Wilts</hi> was made their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator;</hi> and a third time the Earls of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Wilts</hi> were made their <hi>Procurators,</hi> in the matter between the two Dukes of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it may the better appear, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were virtually preſent by their Proxy, it ought to appear that they were allowed to make
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56755:62"/> Proxies, and that the Lords Spiritual did ſo as well as the Temporal Lords. The firſt mention of Proxies that occurs in the memory of our Parliaments is in the Parliament of <hi>Carliſle</hi> under <hi>E.</hi> 1. and that is of the Biſhops Proxies. The words are theſe; <hi>Quia omnes Praelati tunc plenariè non venerunt receptis quibuſdam procuratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Praelator. qui venire non poterant adjornantur.</hi> And in a Parliament held at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> under <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>dorſ. clauſo Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>m.</hi> 11. the Biſhops of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Carliſle</hi> remaining upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are ſeverally commanded to ſtay there, and in the Writ this Clauſe was added to both of them, <hi>Sed Procurat. veſtrum ſufficienter inſtructum, ad dictum diem &amp; locum, mittatis ad conſentiendum his quae tunc ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem praedictos Praelatos &amp; Proceres contigerit ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari.</hi> Though generally Proxies were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to both Spiritual and Temporal Lords, yet when the buſineſs of the Parliament was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, the Writs of Summons both to the Prelates and Barons had a Premonition, that a Proxy ſhould not be allowed, unleſs they could not poſſibly be preſent, <hi>dorſ. clauſ.</hi> 6 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>m.</hi> 36. <hi>clauſ.</hi> 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>m.</hi> 37. 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>m.</hi> 29. Nor was it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual with the Prelates to make ſuch their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators, who were no Members of that Houſe.

                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:56755:63"/> a Canon of his Church. In the Parliament 17 <hi>R.</hi> 2. the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> made <hi>Michael Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaux</hi> Dean of the Arches and others his Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators. In the ſame year the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> his Proxies are <hi>John of Burton</hi> Canon of <hi>Beudly</hi> and others. In the Statute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. it is ſaid, that the advice of the Lords Spiritual being preſent, and of the Procurators of them that were abſent was demanded.

So that it appears, that by the Law of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Proxies of the Biſhops in the 21th. of <hi>R.</hi> 2. were legal Proxies; and conſequently the Biſhops there virtually. Beſides that, the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs thereof doth appear, for that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them by the Parliament, that they ſhould make their Proxies, and be preſent by their Procurators, for this reaſon, leſt otherwiſe the Proceedings in that Parliament ſhould be void.</p>

               <p>IT is true that the Parliament 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. was wholly repealed by 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. but that was for a good reaſon indeed, becauſe that Parliament of 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. had delegated their whole power to a few of their number, who finally without any reſort back to the Houſe made and paſt Laws.</p>
               <p>But did ever any man before the <hi>Octavo</hi> argue at this rate, that becauſe there is one error in a caſe for which the Judgment is reverſed, that therefore there was nothing in the caſe legal and well conſidered.

               <p>For a probable Opinion ſtill continued of the neceſſity of the Biſhops ſitting, which implies a clear Recognition of a Right; for in the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5 the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> petitioned the Houſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe a Judgment given againſt the Earl his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Anno</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. the Error aſſigned was the Abſence of the Spiritual Lords.

               <p>BUt tho' the Actual Exerciſe of the Biſhops Right in their own Perſons (though whatſoever is done by a Deputy, is done in the Right of him that makes the Deputation, as every body knows) was for ſome time diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued (tho' their Right in that time was moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly owned and recognized) yet in 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. we find them re-continuing the Exerciſe of that Right and Authority, and in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſitting in Judgment, upon <hi>William de la Pool,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who was impeach'd of Treaſon by the Commons, for that he had ſold the Realm to the <hi>French</hi> King, and had fortified <hi>Wallingford</hi> Caſtle for a place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. The Impeachment of High Treaſon was brought from the Houſe of Commons, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lords Spiritual and Temporal, ſent thither by the King's Command; the Ninth of <hi>March,</hi> the Duke was brought from the <hi>Tower,</hi> into the Preſence of the King, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal: The Impeachment was read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56755:64"/> and Temporal, who were in Town: They are named, two Arch-Biſhops, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Biſhops, beſides the Temporal Lords, who being aſſembled, the King ſent for the Duke. There was no Judgment given by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but he ſubmitted to the King, and the King gave him Penance; which was, that he ſhould be abſent for Five Years out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, by Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Beaumont,</hi> declared to the King, that this that was ſo decreed, and done againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Duke, proceeded not by their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Council, with this Proteſtation, that it ſhould not be, nor turn in Prejudice, nor Derogation of them, their Heirs, ne, of their Succeſſors in time coming; but that they may have and enjoy their Liberty and Freedom, as largely as ever their Anceſtors, or Predeceſſors had and enjoyed before this time. Obſerve here, that the Lords Spiritual were preſent at every Motion of this Cauſe. This Cauſe was thrice before them, no Exception taken to the Biſhops being Judges. They could not ſit by Permiſſion, without Right; if the Biſhops had no Right to ſit, the Proceedings had been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly erroneous: For though one Judge's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence (if there be a <hi>Quorum</hi>) will not vacate a Judgment; yet if one ſit in Judgment, that is not an Authorized Judge, the Proceeding is certainly erroneous and void. Can any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56755:65"/> that the Government ſhould loſe it ſelf? forget its own Eſtabliſhments in the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns? We may as ſoon believe that a man may forget his own name. One poſitive Act of Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſignifies more than 100 Omiſſions; for if it had not been well underſtood, that the Biſhops had a Right to ſit in Judgment in Capital Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Parliament, they could never have been admitted; they would never have preſumed to endeavour it. But with falſe Logick and abſurd Reaſonings, and diſlike to the Order, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Opinion in this Age, becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Biſhops abſented, that they have no Right.</p>
               <p>But we have one thing further to add, that declares an inherent Right in the Lords Spiritual to the Authority in queſtion; and that is an Opinion of the Judges 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 35. which ſays, that the Lords Spiritual in caſe of a Tryal of a Temporal Peer in Parliament ſhall make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator; for then it ſeems an Opinion was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (which was <hi>error temporis</hi>) That it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent for Biſhops to ſit in their own perſons in Judgment in ſuch caſes. But they themſelves are beſt Judges of what is indecent and unbecoming their Order; for no man is obliged to any man but himſelf, in the matters of Decency, and the meaſures that make things decent or indecent is very mutable, as changable and mutable as Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Faſhions, and Opinions. Beſides that, there is nothing that is very valuable, and is of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56755:65"/> great concernment, but can and ought to ſet aſide and ſuperſede the conſideration of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <p>BUT to complete our Evidence, I will add the conſideration of what remains unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably the Right of the Lords Spiritual, which ſeems to me to be in parity of Reaſon with the Right now in Pretenſe, and that is their Right to be authoritatively preſent and aſſiſting at paſſing Bills of Attainder, which the Biſhops al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exerciſed as the <hi>Folio</hi> ſaith, though he will not think it allowable from thence to infer, that they have rightful Authority when that Houſe doth proceed judicially to Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But I deſire to be informed what differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there is between condemning a man by Act of Parliament, and by Judgment in Parliament. If the death of the man be onely conſidered, it is as much againſt the Canon to condemn the man one way or the other. It's <hi>cauſa &amp; judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſanguinis,</hi> and death follows. Nay, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn a man by Bill of Attainder is more againſt the reaſon of the Canon, than the condemning a man judicially; for the condemning a man judicially is <hi>ex officio Judicis,</hi> but a Bill of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder is an extraordinary uſe of the Legiſlative
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56755:66"/> Power to a purpoſe, which was not deſigned in the Inſtitution. Such an Act is not <hi>ex officio Legiſlatoris,</hi> but the uſing of the Abſolute Power of the Sovereignty upon Reaſons of State. Here one would think if the Canon had any conſideration, any obligation, it ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Biſhops from meddling in ſuch Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Privilegia ne irrogunto</hi> was one of the Laws of the twelve Tables.</p>
               <p>But (if I do rightly underſtand) the reaſon why Biſhops did more frequently, and without pretence of ſcruple or objecting the Canon, aſſiſt in the Bills of Attainder, was for this reaſon, That the weightineſs of the Affair, the high nature of the Proceeding, the extraordinary uſe of the Legiſlative Power, which can be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted onely by extraordinary Reaſons, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Preſence, and put that little pretence of the Canon out of countenance, it could not with any faith to the Government be then ſo much as mentioned for an Excuſe by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
               <p>And this I will ſay, that the Canon hath no more right of reſtraining the Biſhops in Judicial Proceedings, than in the Proceedings upon Bill of Attainder. That it hath not done ſo is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in this, and therefore it did not <hi>de jure</hi> do ſo in the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Folio</hi> Author hath found out a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Reaſon why Biſhops are neceſſary to Acts of Attainder, (but this he ſaith muſt not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56755:66"/> be drawn into an Argument for the Biſhops Right of Judging) and that is, becauſe Rights, Titles, and Intereſts, are made forfeit by Acts of Attainder, which were not forfeitable at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law; and for the doing of this it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary there ſhould be a concurrence of the three Eſtates to bind all Rights. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuppoſeth, that private Acts of Attainder did not always conform themſelves in the matter of Forfeitures to the ſeverity of the Common Law, or general Statute Law: which is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; for before the Statutes of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 20. private Acts of Attainder made no Forfeitures, but what the Common Law made; and ſince the Statutes of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 20. the private Attainders by Parliament have not exceeded thoſe appointed by that Statute, but have often times gone leſs. And therefore the Biſhops were not preſent for the reaſon of making Forfeitures larger, and of more things than the Law at the time being made forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but of common duty, eſpecially in all theſe matters of an extraordinary nature or difficulty, to aſſiſt as Judges and Councellours in that Houſe. And to this that I now ſay, all the Acts of Parliament of private Attainders that I have ſeen, and they are not a few, are agreeable. I believe what he hath ſaid in this matter is not grounded upon any obſervation, but he was willing to find out a Reaſon for what he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to prove, and to offer it without try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56755:67"/> of its truth. Beſides, whatever can be a Law, can be a Law without them, and if they are abſent.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="13" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
               <p>BUT I muſt take notice that we have proved beyond what is neceſſary, to maintain the Lords Spiritual their pretence of Right to judge of the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Pardon, which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, and gives the occaſion of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute. And here I deſire the Reader to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and obſerve, what was heretofore done by the Biſhops in caſe of Hereſie The Biſhop in his Conſiſtory convicted a Heretick, and did never imagine he incurr'd the Canon pretended, (though the delivery over to the Secular Arm, and burning of the Convict if he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, was intended aſſuredly to follow) becauſe he did not award the Execution, and give the final killing Sentence.</p>
               <p>How then can the Canon (if it was a Law as it is not, nor obligeth any man but he that will be obliged) lay any reſtraint upon the Biſhops in judging of the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Pardon. For if they diſlallow his Pardon, and reject his Plea, he is not to be therefore condemned, (though perhaps his Condemnation may follow, as burning doth the Conviction of a Heretick;) but he is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56755:67"/> not <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and merely by rejecting his Plea of Pardon, condemned. For obſerve, I pray, no man is condemned, or caſt in any Suit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not make a good Defence, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſufficiency of the matter whereupon he is charged. Beſides, that it is not without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, that a man hath been tried after a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don pleaded and diſallowed. This every Lawyer knows to be ſo, that if a Plea is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any Declaration, upon which the Plaintiff demurs, if the Plea be ruled a bad Plea, the Defendent hath liberty to take exception to the inſufficiency of the Declaration. So that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is finally and truly given upon the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Charge, becauſe there is a good cauſe of Action, and not becauſe the Defendent hath made a bad Plea.</p>
               <p>So that the Biſhops may judge in their own perſons of the validity of Pardons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being contravenient to the Reaſon of the Canon ſo much talked of is evident; for that the Judgment upon the Pardon is not the final and killing Judgment. The <hi>Folio</hi> hath furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with an Authority for the ſame, out of an ancient Manuſcript Chronicle <hi>in libro Mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſo</hi> he calls it, wherein he ſaith, the Prelates are ſaid to have given their Opinion in 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. for the revocation of certain Pardons of the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> which were granted in 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and in the Parliament of 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. repealed. And though
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56755:68"/> the Chronicle ſaid, ſome blamed the Biſhops, and thought that they had incurred thereby Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. That doth not at all prejudice our Right, nor abate the force of the Teſtimony, that this matter of fact gives to it.</p>
               <p>We reſerved it to this place to add, that as the intention of the Aſſize of <hi>Clarendon</hi> was, to ſet bounds to the Encroachment of the Papal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and in this matter to declare, how far the Biſhops might if they pleaſed obſerve the Canon Law, or rather themſelves, and what was thought then decent to their Order. So according to the Print in <hi>Gervaſius,</hi> and therein he differs from <hi>Matth. Paris</hi>) it is, <hi>Quouſque judicio perveniatur ad mutilationem membrorum vel mortem;</hi> which further clears the meaning of that Law to be, that the Biſhops were thereby excuſed not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from Capital Cauſes, but onely when it was proceeded ſo far in ſuch like Cauſe, that Judgment was to be pronounced, which when the Biſhops had nothing to gainſay, they might depart, and leave Sentence to be pronounced by the Houſe.</p>
               <p>But we cannot after all this allow the Author of the <hi>Folio,</hi> to have ſo little ſenſe, as with a good conſcience to ſay, that he who cannot perhaps by reaſon of his circumſtance, and ſome conſideration of Indecency, execute a thing in his own perſon, therefore cannot do it by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>no more than he can authoriſe one man to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther another.</hi> Thus he ſaith <hi>fol.</hi> 20. when ſurely
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56755:68"/> this Gentleman cannot think it as fit for a Judge to be a Hang-man, as to ſign a Kalendar for the Execution of the Condemned Priſoners.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Octavo</hi> is ſomewhat ſurprizing in this matter: For he doth affirm, That it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Biſhops to vote in any Queſtion preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary and preparatory to the Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, when ſuch Sentence follows, and the matter preliminary is neceſſary to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. This he proves by a <hi>Logick</hi> Rule, <hi>Cauſa Cauſae, eſt Cauſa Cauſati;</hi> one of <hi>Sthalius</hi> his Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioms, hath turn'd round the Head of this Gentleman. I find few men can bear Axioms, Maxims, and Sentences. There are none ſpeak ſo much unnatural Non-ſence, as they that uſe them moſt. May not ſeveral men, I pray, do ſeveral parts of an affair; and yet he that doth the firſt part, is no ways the Cauſe of what another man doth in the ſecond and third place? Is the acting the firſt part of the Play, the cauſe of acting the laſt; Or, is the laying the Foundation, the Cauſe that lays on the Roof? Is the Jury the Cauſe of any more than their Verdict? And doth not the Court give Judgment by their own Authority and Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</p>
               <p>If men would ſpeak by Nature, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to firſt Notions, and were not ſo full of ſecond Notions, and Univerſals, we ſhould not have ſo many Errors, Miſtakes, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding Opinions in the Work.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:56755:69"/>
               <p>But this we complain of as too ſevere in the <hi>Octavo;</hi> that when he had confounded us with his <hi>Cauſa Cauſae, &amp; Cauſati,</hi> he would render us ridiculous with a Story of a Friar, out of <hi>Chaucer,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>That would of a Capon, the Liver, of a Pig, the Head;</l>
                     <l>But would, that nothing for him ſhould be dead.</l>
                  </q> This indeed was a fine piece of Wit in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; but tranſlated hither by our Author, is an inſipid piece of Malice. His Deſign ſure in this, was, to enter the Biſhops amongſt <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars; and then the Learned Readers of <hi>Chaucer,</hi> would be very conceited upon them; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all his pleaſant Satyrs againſt the Friars, to the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>But for the farther Evidence of the Biſhops Baronage, and their <hi>Jus paritatis,</hi> it would not be impertinent here, to add, That the Names of <hi>Barons, Peers, Seniors, Grants,</hi> have been attributed to the Lords Spiritual, in all times, in Authentick Hiſtories and Records. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as a Nominal Argument, is not a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial Topick in ſuch a Cauſe as this. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that this will deſtroy the very ſtrength of our Adverſaries; which lies in this, that they will not allow Prelates to be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Name of <hi>Peers, Grants,</hi> and <hi>Barons.</hi> And that where the Records doth not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention Prelates, they will conclude, they were not meant or intended to be preſent:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56755:69"/> But the Collection which was made for this purpoſe, ſhall not trouble the Reader, becauſe in two Books ſince Printed, in Defence of the Biſhops Right in queſtion, this is abundantly performed. Beſides, that it is a very precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Concluſion, that our Adverſaries make, and without argument: For they ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves herein, upon a moſt unreaſonable <hi>Poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum, viz.</hi> That Titles do not belong to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for whom they were made; and to whoſe Character they agree; and that Words do not deſign the things which they were made and impoſed to ſignifie.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
               <p>NOw we ſhall proceed to perform a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry piece of Juſtice to the Prelates, as well as a Right to the Government, to recover its true Conſtitution, from the Prejudice of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Ignorance, to declare and manifeſt, that our Gvernment doth conſiſt of three States, the Lords Spiritual, and Temporal, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe do make the Great Council of the Kingdom, and miniſter to the King, Council and Auxiliaries; over which the King doth preſide as the Great Superintendent, and mover of this mighty <hi>Machin.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:56755:70"/>
               <p>The conſequence of which is, that the Biſhops cannot be detruded from that place they bear in the Conſtitution of the Government, for that no Government can be legally or by any lawful power changed, but muſt remain for ever once eſtabliſhed. And it cannot be no leſs than Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State to attempt a change, no Authority in the world is competent to make any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Princes of Chriſtendom, after they took to themſelves the Election of Biſhops, which is a natural right of the Sovereign Power, become Chriſtian, they ſoon obſerved the advantage that they might make by advancing them to the greateſt Secular Dignities, Governments, and Truſts; and did accordingly advance them to an equality, if not to a ſuperiority, to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Secular Nobility; gave them Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, Marquiſates, Baronies, and rich Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and erected that Order into a ſucceſſive Nobility. Another ſort of Nobility from that of the Lay Princes, concluding that they ſhould be better ſerved by men of their own choice and approved worthineſs, (who had alſo other advantages over the People, than thoſe that the Temporal Princes and Lords had, by that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence they paid to their Biſhops, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power that they had over them in the virtue of Religion) than by the Hereditary Princes and Nobility, who did not always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the virtue of the original Anceſtors, and the firſt ſtock.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:56755:70"/>
               <p>Beſides that, Religious Kings and Sovereign Princes did by advancing Biſhops intend to do great advantages and honour to Religion; but withall they did not divide the Biſhops thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, from the Secular Princes and Noblemen in Councils, for then they had loſt their deſign. The Biſhops could not have had any direct influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Councils of the Nobles and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes, nor have tempered their Debates with an excellent Charity and firm Loyalty, and other Vertues which belong to their Character. It would have made trouble, diſtraction, and impediment in the Affairs of Princes, and emulation and ſtrife and faction between the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Secular Orders and ſeveral miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and great inconveniencies would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, if they had been divided and ſeparated in ſeveral Colleges, and had had in conſequence thereof a Negative upon each other, as they then of neceſſity muſt. But by uniting both Orders into one Council and Aſſembly, diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in Councils and impediments to the Affairs of Princes are avoided. And we are aſſured of a more wiſe, as well as an unanimous and more authoritative Reſult in all Councils and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; which if the <hi>Octavo</hi> had duly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he would not have depraved and diſparaged this wiſe Conſtitution, by comparing it to a neſt of Boxes.</p>
               <p>They were therefore for theſe great Reaſons, both Spiritual and Secular Lords, united in the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56755:71"/> great Councils of Kingdoms, and theſe two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Nobles Spiritual and Secular, became the two States, which together with the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the People the third State, made the Parliaments Diets and Convention of State, under which Names the great Aſſembly which we call a Parliament, in the ſeveral Sovereignties of Chriſtian <hi>Europe</hi> hath reſpectively paſſed.</p>

               <p>Biſhops were made Dukes and Counts in <hi>France,</hi> and alſo Peers in <hi>France;</hi> and about this time, out of the Princes, Dukes and Counts, the number of 12 were ſelected by the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and erected into the Title of the 12 Peers of <hi>France:</hi> by which Dignity, they became the Chief Councellors, and Directors of State. Theſe twelve being choſen, beſides their being Peers in matters of Judgment, in the Old Parliaments, were Peers alſo in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the whole Kingdom; and while their Greatneſs held, were therein ſo Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they added a Taſte of <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> to that great Monarchy (not diſagreable to the Title that our Peers aſſumed of being <hi>Pares Regis,</hi> and having a Power, <hi>Fraenum imponere
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56755:72"/> Regi,</hi> as <hi>Bracton</hi> tells us; but he and his Law both are antiquated. Of theſe, ſix were Lay, and ſix were Eccleſiaſtical; but the Dignity of <hi>Pair,</hi> is ſuppoſed in theſe Biſhops, not as they are Biſhops; but as being Dukes and Counts alſo; that is, in the firſt three, <hi>viz. Rhemes, Laon, Langres,</hi> as Dukes, and of <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois, Chalous,</hi> and <hi>Noyons,</hi> as Counts.</p>
               <p>Theſe twelve Peers of <hi>France</hi> had ſuch a Power towards the Ancient Kings of <hi>France,</hi> as the <hi>Ephori</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the <hi>Juſticiaries</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> had towards their Kings. They were obliged to exerciſe that Power with Care, and they did exert it towards their Kings. What they did agreable to the Power aſſigned them in the Government, was lawful and juſt; nay, their bounden Duty. But certainly, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of theſe Powers was againſt no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God: For God makes no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor obligeth us to obey any, but what are made by Men: The Government it ſelf is its own Meaſure. It's no Objection againſt the Lawfulneſs of any Government, that it's incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, if they like it notwithſtanding, whoſe Government it is. But this Conſtitution was of advantage to Royal Families, in that it made a kind of Entail of the Crown upon their Families, and preſerved the Monarchy and its Deſcent: And beſides, had this farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, that it was under them impoſſible for a Nation, or Kingdom to be undone in a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56755:73"/> trice for a Caprice of the Prince, or deſtroyed to make a Fortune for ſome Up-ſtart.</p>
               <p>For the Sake of Mankind, it is to be earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired and prayed, that ſuch as they who derive no Honour from their Anceſtors, may leave none to their Children, that themſelves may ſurvive their Honors, and leave nothing of their Fortunes to their Children, but what they themſelves could deſerve, <hi>viz.</hi> Hate and Infamy. All Uſurpation and Encroachment of Power is to be oppoſed where it can be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as the greateſt Miſchief, and the Miniſters to the Deſigns hated and deteſted as the moſt pernicious and loathſome Vermine.</p>

               <p>BUt to return, agreable to this Policy of Sovereign Princes, who had the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhopricks, of advancing Biſhops to the higheſt ſecular Dignities and Truſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi> did create Biſhops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Barons, and exacted the Services and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of Barons in the Great Council of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by putting their Lands under Tenure by Barony: he gave them no new Endowments; but as a Conqueror, he confirmed their Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Poſſeſſions, under a new reſerv'd Tenure, and annex'd to their Order, a Secular Honor,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56755:73"/> a ſucceſſive Baronage. Since the Conquerour the title of Baron took the place of that of <hi>Thane,</hi> which was likewiſe a Feudal Honour in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons</hi> time. By <hi>William the Conquerour</hi> Baronies were feudal, and in congruity to the State of the Lay Nobles he made the Biſhops feudal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, for there was no other than feudal Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at that time.</p>
               <p>It will not be amiſs, nor time miſpent, here to give a ſhort account of the Government in the Conquerours time, of the Baronage by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, and the policy thereof, and of the change made in the Baronage of <hi>England</hi> in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time. Becauſe from thence we muſt derive the Biſhops Right now in queſtion, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and virtually contained in their Right of Baronage. Hereby it will appear, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were of the <hi>Barones majores,</hi> and of the <hi>Barones majores</hi> the firſt in Dignity, that they became feudal Barons in the Conquerour's time, and when the reaſon of our Baronage changed, and no man continued a Baron <hi>ratione tenurae,</hi> it cannot with reaſon be ſaid, that the Biſhops are Barons onely for the ſake of their Lands, which our Adverſaries do inſiſt upon, for that they think it is an abatement to the Honour of Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and a prejudice to their Right in queſtion: but becauſe it has been ſaid before by men of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Law, and grown up to be a vulgar error, we will now diſcharge the miſtake, by affixing here the Hiſtory and Reaſon of the change.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:56755:74"/>
               <p>It was the policy of the firſt <hi>William,</hi> (for ſome are ſo critical they will not call him <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour</hi>) to create new Tenures upon all the great Poſſeſſions of the Realm, and impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the principal men to hold their Lands of him <hi>in capite,</hi> under ſuch Services that were neceſſary in peace and war for State and Juſtice, and by putting all the conſiderable men of the Realm under Oaths of Fealty incident to thoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, beſides the Oaths of Allegeance, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the eſtabliſhment of his Conqueſt, or his poſſeſſion of the Crown without title. The principal men of the Realm, both Eccleſiaſtical and Lay, hereby were not onely obliged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but to become part of the Government, and were obliged to be Miniſters of Juſtice, and alſo Members of the great Council of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Parliament, which was now to be made up principally of his Dependents; by which he changed the conſtitution of the great Council in the <hi>Saxons</hi> times, &amp; in the balance of that equal ſort of Government, the conſequent miſchiefs whereof this Kingdom laboured under, untill we recovered it again by an equal repreſentative of the Commons in Parliament, in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third. The power of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage proved equally oppreſſive to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and came in that time to be reduced irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent to the Crown. By this policy the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour intended to eſtabliſh his Conqueſt, to ſecure to himſelf, and his poſterity, the Imperial
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56755:74"/> Crown of <hi>England,</hi> imagining, that otherwiſe he ſhould have been but a precarious King.</p>
               <p>He had now turn'd the Kingdom upon the matter, into one great Mannor, and kept his Courts, called, the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> in the nature of a Sovereign Court Baron; now become more frequented and ſolemn, than that Court was before the Conqueſt, thrice in every Year, at ſtated Times, and Places, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> at <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> at <hi>Glouceſter:</hi> at theſe times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all his Tenants, which were all the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Free-holders of <hi>England,</hi> attended of courſe; and upon a General Summons at any other time or place appointed by the King, as his Affairs did require, they were bound like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to attend.</p>
               <p>In theſe Courts the Suitors ſwore Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did renew and confirm their Obligations to the Crown, and the King became more aſſured of their Allegiance, by their Perſonal Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and by his Royal Entertainments of them at ſuch times.</p>
               <p>In theſe Courts they recognized their own Services, and the Rights of the King, their Lord, and aſſeſſed Aids and Eſtuage, Preſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons due to the Crown, by their Tenures upon themſelves, to which in general they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by their Tenures. In theſe Conventions the Right of the Suitors, the King's Tenants were adjudged, as Private Lords had Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56755:75"/> of the Right of Lands, in pretence held of them in Fee, in their ſeveral Manors, as they have to this day. But if Right was not done by the Lord, the Cauſe was to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to this <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> the King being Lord Paramount, of whom all Eſtates, mediately, or immediately were held: Which appears by the Form of the Writ of Right now in uſe, which we will tranſcribe, N. B. <hi>precipimus tibi quod ſine dilatione plenum Rectum teneas</hi> A. <hi>de</hi> B. <hi>de uno Meſſuagio</hi> L. <hi>in</hi> I, <hi>quae clamat tenere de te per liberum Servitium unius denarii per annum pro omni ſervitio, quod</hi> W. <hi>de</hi> T. <hi>ei deforciat; &amp; ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi feceris Vicecomes faciatne amplius inde Clamorem audiamus pro defectu Recti.</hi> The Common Pleas was not then a Court, and at this time the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal and reſort to the King, was in this Court, if Juſtice was not done by the Lord or Sheriff. So that the greateſt part of the Juſtice of the Nation was adminiſtred in thoſe Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>But it muſt not be underſtood, that this vaſt Convention was a Court of Judicature for every Cauſe; neither, that it was formally a Parliament, without ſome farther Act of the King, for ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that Convention into the great Council of the Nation.</p>
               <p>But in this <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> they were obliged to anſwer the King's Writs of Summons, Writs of Commiſſion, and obey his Appointments in the Ordinary Adminiſtration of Juſtice, in which the <hi>Capitalis Juſticiarius,</hi> or <hi>Juſtitia</hi> was to preſide.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:56755:75"/>
               <p>That this was not a Judicature, the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe that made it, the inequality of the Perſons conſidered under the Common Reaſon of being Tenants in <hi>Capite,</hi> and Barons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they became indifferently members of the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> beſides the neglect that muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be preſumed in the greateſt part of ſuch a Body, to the buſineſs of Juriſdiction and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Rights, without particular Deſignation thereto, do ſufficiently argue and evince. But as many of them as were moſt proper to judge, or aſſiſt in the Judgment, as the Caſe did require, were appointed by the King, or his <hi>Capitalis Juſticiarius.</hi> And that it was ſo in Fact, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by that Famous Cauſe, wherein Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Lanfranck,</hi> recovered againſt <hi>Odo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Baieux,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent. Eadmerus Hiſt.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56755:76"/> that Country, or of any other, where any of the Lands lay as Aſſiſtants to him: For our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian ſaith, that <hi>Lanfranck,</hi> (though <hi>Godfred</hi> pronounced the Judgment) did recover <hi>judicio Baronum qui placita tenuerunt.</hi> The <hi>probi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> were ſuch, by whom the truth of the matter might be better underſtood, and did probably enquire of it, who did accord and agree the Judgment to be right. <hi>Lanfranc</hi> did recover <hi>ex communi omnium aſtipulatione &amp; judicio,</hi> as our Hiſtorian alſo informs us. I might cite many more Records of the Method of the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice in this <hi>Curia Regis;</hi> but I ſhould be too long in this matter, not being ſtrictly neceſſary to the Queſtion in hand, though the underſtanding of the Nature of this Court, and the Conſtitution of the Government at this time, will many ways inſerve to the clearing the Right thereof.</p>
               <p>In this Court Peers were tryed, all Pleas of the Crown heard; and whatever is now the Buſineſs of the Courts of Common Pleas and Exchequer, was diſpatch'd in this <hi>Curia Regis.</hi> Here Fines were levyed, as appears by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord furniſhed to us, by Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman,</hi> in his <hi>Gloſſ. f.</hi> 279. the word <hi>Fines.</hi> There men famous for their Skill in the Law, did attend, and by this Judicature, ſome place was aſſigned them, where they were to hear ſuch Cauſes as were referred and ſent down to them and it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible, that Fines may be levyed, <hi>i. e.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56755:76"/> made of the thing in pretence, that was referred to them; and it may be true, that in a Charter of a Grant of <hi>Conuſance</hi> of Cauſes, Words may be conteined for excluding the Intromiſſions of the Juſtices of the one Bench, and the other: For ſuch Charters never want words. Theſe matters are produced by Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coke,</hi> in his Preface to the Eighth Report, to prove that the Common Pleas was a Court before the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of King <hi>John;</hi> for that theſe matters are in time before that Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but theſe Juſtices were no other than Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to the <hi>Curia Regis:</hi> They were not ſuch Juſtices as now make that Court, all Common Pleas being now appropriated to their Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For the Writs, before that Charter, were returnable, <hi>coram me, vel Juſtitia mea, Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap</hi> 6. but after that Charter, they were returnable, <hi>coram Juſticiariis meis apud Weſtmonaſterium. Bracton. l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, all Common Pleas were adjudged in the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> and that Court did ſend down the Cauſe to ſuch as did attend that Court, to receive its References. By <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, cap.</hi> 11. it was provided, <hi>Communia placita non ſequantur Curiam noſtram, ſed teneantur in ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo certo loco:</hi> And now Writs were made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnable there, the Common Pleas were taken out of the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> one Judicature was appointed for all Cauſes between the Subjects, and one place of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56755:77"/> Attendance for Litigants. By this Proviſion, Juſtice was adminiſtred without Noiſe and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult; the Adminiſtration of it committed to men of Skill; and to ſuch who might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for their Judgments, and from whom it might be appealed.</p>
               <p>But after <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> made by King <hi>John,</hi> and confirmed by <hi>H.</hi> 3, 9. the Authority con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued of the <hi>Juſtitia,</hi> or <hi>capitalis Juſticiarius:</hi> to him was the reſort for Writs, from whence all Judicial Authority was ſtill derived: He did direct and bound the Juſtice of the Court of Common Pleas, by ſuch <hi>Formula's</hi> as were allowed in the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> where the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and his Colledge of Clerks did attend for the forming of Writs, according to the nature of the Complaint, with the Allowance of that Court; but the Authority of this Court ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Office of this great Juſticiary, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of <hi>H.</hi> 3. we find in the Statutes of <hi>Glouc.</hi> 6 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7. Laws for a Writ of Entry to be granted to the Reverſioner, where Tenant in Dower, Aliens in Fee, though her Alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a Forfeiture of that Eſtate at Common Law: But it ſeems there had been no ſuch Writ yet formed; and the Chancellor had no ſuch Power of forming a new Writ. That Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute provides, that in that Caſe, there ſhall be a Writ of Entry thereof made in Chancery, which is called, A Writ of Entry <hi>in caſu pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56755:77"/>
               <p>And for that Power might not be wanting in the Chancellor to iſſue out new Writs where no Writs before formed were fitted to the Caſe; So that Writs in Caſes of like reaſon had been granted; by <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. it was provided, <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſcunque evenerit in Cancellaria quod in uno caſu reperitur Breve, &amp; in conſimili caſu cadente ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li indigente remedio concordent Clerici de Cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laria in Brevi faciendo.</hi> Whereas in the full Authority of the Court of the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> no Right could have failed of a Remedy: For <hi>Jura ſunt matres Actionum.</hi> But Derivative Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, are always <hi>ſtricti Juris;</hi> no Rights are now remediable, but where they are in a Parity of Reaſon, or Analogy with ſuch Rights as had received relief in the time of that Great and Original Judicature.</p>
               <p>So inconvenient are thoſe Reformations, that reform by pulling down: Want of Authority to do Right, is a greater Fault in Government, than the allowance of a Power that may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to Wrong and Oppreſſion: But this is the true reaſon why we have ſo many Cauſes irremediable at Common Law, petitioning for relief at this day in our Court of Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; though, if the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2. before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, were well improved, the Defects of our Law would not be ſo ſhameful and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid, it appears, that the Common Pleas was not an Original Court, or
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56755:78"/> a Court of ordinary Juriſdiction in the Firſt Conſtitution of the Government; and ſuch it remains and continues to this time: For that Court cannot proceed to Judgment in any Cauſe, without an Original Writ out of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, though a late Statute makes their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments good, without an Original upon a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. If the Cauſes that are properly now of the cogniſance of that Court of Common Pleas, had been allotted to that Court Originally, when the diſtribution of Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice was made in the Conſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that Court, by its proper Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and its own Proceſs, would have done Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to all its Suitors, without firſt expecting a Writ out of Chancery, to bring the Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; or leaving any right without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to complain in Chancery of the defects of Juſtice in that Court.</p>
               <p>But that Law of <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 11. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, which erected the Court of Common Pleas, fix'd the Judges, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated civil Cauſes to their Judicature, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger now ambulatory, was the firſt ſtep that was made to reduce the Court of Barons, called, <hi>Curia Domini Regis,</hi> in which the <hi>Capitalis Juſticiarius</hi> did preſide; Yet ſtill this Court continued a Court of Pleas of the Crown and Appeals, and for thoſe that had the Priviledge of that Court, as Officers, Dependents, Suitors, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Bracton, l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Rex habet unam
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56755:78"/> propriam Curiam ſicut Aulam Regiam, &amp; Juſtitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios Capitales, qui proprias cauſas Regias terminant &amp; aliorum omnium per querelam, (i. e. Appeal) vel per privilegium ſeu libertatem.</hi> This Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> imagines is meant of the Kings Bench, but that muſt be a miſtake, for <hi>ſicut Aula Regia</hi> is not competent to that Court as now, the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales Juſtitiarii</hi> were not the Chief Juſtices we now have: For the Office of the <hi>Capitalis Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiarius</hi> did yet continue. But then that which follows in <hi>Bracton,</hi> the deſcription of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Court he before ſpake of puts the matter out of doubt; <hi>Item</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Juſtitiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum quidam ſunt capitales, generales, perpetui, &amp; majores, à latere Regis reſidentes;</hi> which terms are agreeable to none but the Barons.</p>
               <p>But this ſort of Judicature was not fit for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and the Barons were to be reduced, they were diſmiſt of this Juriſdiction about the time that change was made, in reference to them in the Parliament; for as long as they continued in their numbers and power ſo great as they were; both Courts and Parliaments were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with tumultuous heaps of people, brought thither by the Barons to countenance their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, of which who will may ſee enough in <hi>Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus.</hi> And this reducement was (I doubt not) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 3. when the firſt Writs were iſſued to chuſe Knights of the Shire. <hi>Philip Baſſet</hi> was the laſt of theſe <hi>Capitales Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarii;</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Spelmans Gloſſary p.</hi> 415.

               <p>That ancient Style of <hi>Capitalis Juſtitiarius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae</hi> is now allowed to the Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, though his legal Style is <hi>Capitalis Juſtitiarius ad placita coram Rege tenenda.</hi> 2 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>Radulphus Hengham</hi> was made the firſt Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Kings Bench, as Sir <hi>Henry Spelmans Gloſſary</hi> 416. But the Chief Juſtices of the Common Pleas were firſt made about the time of King <hi>John's Magna Charta,</hi> when that Court was fixed, as is before remembered. Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> out of <hi>Florilegus</hi> tells us, <hi>Martin Pete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhus</hi> was Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas, 1 <hi>H.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Neither did <hi>E.</hi> 1. truſt the Barons with the Government of his Revenue, as it was before the <hi>Capitalis Juſtic.</hi> and the power of the Barons was reduced; but he made <hi>Adam de Stratton</hi> a Clerk Chief Baron, but in what time of his Reign doth not appear.</p>
               <p>But they continued after they were reduced from the buſineſs of the Kings Bench, and from that of the Court of Common Pleas, to have the Government of the Revenue, and making a Court of Exchequer. And they ſtill continued
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56755:79"/> the Exerciſe of their ancient ordinary Right, and judged Common Pleas in the Exchequer until the 28 <hi>E.</hi> 1. And then in the Statute called <hi>Articuli ſuper Cartas cap.</hi> 4. it was enacted, That no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas ſhall be henceforth held in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, contrary to the form of the Great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Their exerciſing their power laſtly in that Court, may be the reaſon why the Judges of that Court are called Barons. Sir <hi>Henry Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſaith, he hath an uninterrupted Succeſſion of the Barons of the Exchequer, from the ſixth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second; by which it appears, that the preſent Conſtitution was eſtabliſhed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Kings Bench and Common Pleas were made ſuch as they now are.</p>
               <p>But there was one Power and Authority that was inſeparable from the Baronage, and that is the Tryal of Peers, the ancient <hi>Curia Regis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to this day to that purpoſe, as it muſt, no other proviſion being ever ſince made therein. This is the ancient Court of Peers, the <hi>Curia Regis</hi> when revived. The Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ancient <hi>Capitalis Juſtitiarius</hi> is as often revived, as that Court is erected for Tryal; for Offices at Common Law can be no more nor leſs than the Law appointed. That he is called <hi>High Steward</hi> is no Objection to us, for ſo was the <hi>Capitalis Juſtitiarius</hi> called, and <hi>Juſtitiarius</hi> and <hi>Seneſchallus</hi> are uſed one for another in the Language of thoſe times; Sir <hi>Henry Spelmans Gloſſary</hi> 403. And this is the true reaſon, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56755:80"/> conceive, of that Tradition, that the <hi>High Steward</hi> by the Kings conſtituting him ſuch, hath ſuch mighty powers that are fit to be truſted with him, no longer than while he is buſie about that piece of Juſtice for which he is appointed; and he is not to receive his Commiſſion, but juſt at his entry upon the buſineſs of the Court, and not before. The power of this <hi>Capitalis Juſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius</hi> was the ſame with that of the <hi>Mair of the Palace</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> from whence the Conquerour brought this Office, which was the ſame or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Authority of the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> amongſt the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a thing to be wiſhed, that Gentlemen that apply themſelves to the ſtudy of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that relate to our Laws and Government, would deſign to adorn and cultivate the preſent Laws, and to make out their reaſonableneſs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to innovate upon us, by bringing back what is obſolete, rejected, and antiquated; and that they would contribute what they can to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it from many abſurd reaſons that diſhonour our Faculty, which are the beſt our Books afford even for ſome of the <hi>Regulae juris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall inſtance onely in one or two of them: Why the Father cannot inherit the Lands of the Son, it is told us for a reaſon in our Books, that <hi>Terra eſt quid ponderoſum,</hi> and will not aſcend in the right line; whereas the true reaſon is this, the Lord that firſt granted the Fee neglected the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, gave it to the Son and his Deſcendents, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56755:80"/> to the Family he ſhould derive from himſelf; and when this was alienated in Fee, the deſcent of it was directed agreeably to the manner and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the firſt Collation. If the Father gave the Son the Eſtate, there was a Tenure created, of the Father, as there was in all Feofments of the Feoffer, before the Statute of <hi>Quia emptores ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum;</hi> and it is a Rule in Law, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>haeres &amp; dominus; Stamford's Expoſition of the Prerogative, chap.</hi> 5. <hi>fol.</hi> 23. <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If before the Statute of <hi>Quia emptores,</hi> the eldeſt Son had enfeoffed the middlemoſt, to hold of him, and had taken his Homage; the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dieth without Iſſue, the youngeſt ſhould have had the Land, and not the eldeſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit if there were no youngeſt Son, or any other Heir, than the Feoffor might claim the Land again by Eſcheat, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Another is this for a reaſon in our Law, why the Children of ſeveral <hi>venters</hi> ſhall not inherit each others Lands: it is told us, it is ſo becauſe they are but of the half blood to one another, and therefore the Brother of the firſt <hi>venter</hi> ſhall not ſucceed to the State of the Brother by a ſecond <hi>venter</hi> which dies without Iſſue, But the Land muſt deſcend to the Uncle, But this Uncle can be but of the half blood to the Nephew, and the very reaſon that is given for the Law makes the Law unreaſonable. But the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Brothers of different <hi>venters</hi> cannot inherit each other, is a diſallowance that our
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56755:81"/> Anceſtors, the <hi>Saxons,</hi> had of ſecond Marriages, they, as moſt of the <hi>Germane</hi> Nations, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as <hi>concubinat,</hi> and at beſt, but as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Fornication: So <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us, in his Book, <hi>de moribus Germanorum,</hi> that they did not allow of Second Marriages, <hi>Ne non maritum, ſed matrimonium ament, non nuptam ſed nuptias;</hi> and agreable to this Opinion, are deſcents go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in ſeveral Countries in <hi>Germany</hi> at this day.</p>
               <p>This (tho' it is apt to excite all Gentlemen of the Robe, never to acquieſce in any reaſon of the Law that is not ſence, which if they do, they will forfeit their Reaſon and Judgment) I ſhould not have been ſo impertinent as to have mentioned in this Diſcourſe; but that this deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Cauſes without the exerciſe of clear rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon about them, hath brought it to paſs, that much of our Law will not ſort to Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice; and this gave one great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Riſe and Growth of the Court of Chancery. Since it came in my way, to ſhew the Original of the other Courts; and the Reader may wonder, that there is nothing in Antiquity, that gives Authority to ſo celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo buſie a Court as this is at this day: I will here offer an account of the Riſe and Growth of it; which will prepare the way for taking of it down, which is no leſs a Reproach, than it is a Grievance to the Nation.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:56755:81"/>
               <p>There is nothing ſo great a Reproach to a Nation, than to have Laws that are confeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not good and equal, to continue them; and yet to allow of an Authority to reproach them with Iniquity: that our Courts of Law ſhould be under Rules and Obligations, to pronounce Judgments, which a ſingle Gentleman ſhall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively controul and condemn, as unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; that Law and Equity ſhould be Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites; That a Judgment muſt be made up, and formd in a Caſe, and what is equal, juſt and fit therein, muſt not be conſidered, though it can be, and will, in another Court have a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Our Judges at Law, take themſelves bound, not to hear, or regard the Allegations of the Defendants againſt the Plaintiffs pretence, which ought in good reaſon to bar them therein; or, at leaſt, qualifie the Judgments, when the ſame matter ſhall be heard in Chancery, and prevail either wholly to ſet aſide, or to qualifie the ſame Judgments.</p>
               <p>This is not only to be complain'd of as dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the Reputation of the Wiſdom of the Nation; but is inſufferably oppreſſive to the Subject, by the multiplicity of Suits, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vexatious Delays: Nay, by this ill Contrivance, the Expences ſometimes equal, ſometimes exceed the Value of the Right, which is litigated, and which is worſe, the Event of the Suit is very uncertain and fortuitous.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:56755:82"/>
               <p>But this is not all; our Law, it ſeems, is not a Rule that extends it ſelf to all Cauſes; and we have Rights confeſſedly, ſuch, and which can be judicially remedied, to which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law extends no Relief: For a thouſand Cauſes in a year, are for that reaſon heard in the Court of Chancery.</p>
               <p>Two ſuch Reproaches, no Nation but ours hath ever yet incurr'd or ſuffer'd: For Law and Equity is no where elſe oppoſed, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Right hath his Remedy by the Law of the Country, but ours.</p>
               <p>The firſt great occaſion to the riſe of the Chancery, was, Feoffments, made upon Truſt, to uſes in the time of our Warring about the Title of the Crown, to avoid Forfeitures. The Judges, in tenderneſs to the Condition and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of thoſe times, did judge, that an Uſe was no Right, though moſt certainly it is: For it is <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> that nothing might be forfeited when it depended upon chance whether a man ſhould be a good Subject, or a Traitor. And the ſame conſideration eaſily admitted of any Authority that would interpoſe to relieve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who would abuſe or deny ſuch Truſts; and no body brought into queſtion, that authority, by which a piece of juſtice, ſo neceſſary to the Nation, was adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>Another great reaſon of the buſineſs of the Court of Chancery, is that which we before-mentioned, that we have not improv'd the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56755:82"/> Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2 <hi>C.</hi> 24. And a third, is the ill conducting of our Laws: our Ancient Judges were infected with the Monkery of that time, men of no Learning, and of a vain Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Theology of thoſe times was inſipid, and moſt trifling, and the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, agreably turned into a vain art of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the <hi>apices juris;</hi> and a ſubtilty was uſed, too fine for buſineſs, and to govern the affairs of Men that governed themſelves by none of thoſe Superfineries. They argued without Diſcourſe, or diſcourſed from poſitive Rules or Preſidents, which were almoſt the ſame with them as Rules of Law, and not from the true Merits of the Cauſe, and its own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſons of Right.</p>
               <p>And the Common Law, which is <hi>Lex non ſcripta, i. e.</hi> that which a wiſe Judicature ſhould declare, upon the conſideration of the preſent Caſe, was by the Proceedings of our Courts, turn'd into a <hi>Lex ſcripta,</hi> poſitive and inflexible; and the Rule of Juſtice could not accomodate it ſelf to every Caſe, according to the Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Right and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>But if it were conſider'd, that there can be no Preſcription againſt Juſtice, that no Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, where a Right hath not been relieved, can be pretended why it ſhould not be aſſiſted hereafter: And if a matter pleaded in Bar, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Defendant will be certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Chancery, may, notwithſtanding it
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56755:83"/> hath not heretofore, be hereafter allowed in our Law-Courts, we ſhould be in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reſtored to our eaſie, expedite, cheap, and certain Juſtice, which the Methods of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law-Courts hath moſt excellently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, until a Parliament, ſometime, or other, may conſider, whether it be not fit to take it quite down, by inabling Courts of Law, to do true Right in all Cauſes that ſhall come before them: For nothing renders the Chancery tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but the mo: exemplary Virtue, and Great Endowments of our preſent Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, in which he is not like to have a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</p>
               <p>But to return to the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> it was not only the great Judicature of the Nation formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but it was alſo materially our Parliament too.</p>
               <p>That this <hi>Curia Regis</hi> was not without any more, the Parliament of theſe times, is evident: firſt, that the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> was ſummoned by a general Writ of Summons, directed to the Sheriffs in this Form, <hi>viz. Rex Vicecomiti</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamptoniae, <hi>&amp;c. praecipimus tibi quod ſummone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri facias Archiepiſcopos, Epiſcopos, Comites, Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Abbates, Priores, Milites, &amp; Liberos homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, qui de nobis tenent in Capite, &amp;c. Rot. Clauſ.</hi> 26 <hi>H.</hi> 3 <hi>M.</hi> 7. <hi>Dorſo.</hi> This muſt neceſſarily be this <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> in Diſtinction to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:56755:83"/>
               <p>For that in the Grand Charter of King <hi>John,</hi> made in the laſt year of his Reign, it was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Ad habendum Commune Concilium Regni, de auxilio aſſidendo, (aliter quàm in tribus praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis caſibus; i. e.</hi> Thoſe caſes of Aid, to make the eldeſt Son a Knight to marry the eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of Ranſom, and <hi>de Scutagiis aſſidendis) faciemus ſummoneri Archiepiſcopos, Epiſcopos, Abba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, &amp; Comites, &amp; majores Barones Regni, ſigillatim per Literas noſtras. Et praeterea faciemus ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neri in generali per Vicecomites &amp; Ballivos noſtros omnes alios, qui in capite tenent de nobis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At preſent we make no other uſe of this Grand Charter, than to prove it a diſtinctive mark of a Parliament, where the Summons are perſonal to the Biſhops, Earls, and the greater Barons. This Charter of King <hi>Johns</hi> declares the ancient uſage of ſummoning the greater Barons, by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Summons to them ſeverally directed; for that the Kings before him, as Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his <hi>Gloſſary p.</hi> 80. <hi>Propter crebra bella &amp; ſimulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, quas aliquando habuêre cum his ipſis majoribus ſuis Baronibus, alios etiam eorum interdum omitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, &amp; aegrè hoc ferentes Proceres Johannem ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gêre ſub magno ſigillo Angliae paciſci, ut Archiepiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos, Epiſcopos, Comites, &amp; majores Barones Regni, ſigillatim per Literas ſummoneri faceret.</hi> By which it was provided, that all the Barons ſhould have <hi>pro more</hi> Summons to the Parliament, that non of thoſe great Barons ſhould want his ſeveral Summons, and they had anciently ſeveral Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56755:84"/> for in a general Summons no body was excluded. By which it doth appear that the Council at <hi>Northampton</hi> wherein <hi>Thomas of Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> was brought in judgment, was a Parliament, and not the <hi>Curia Regis;</hi> for that the Biſhops had their ſeveral Writs of Summons, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in that <hi>Fitz Stephens</hi> tells us as matter of obſervation, that <hi>Thomas of Canterbury</hi> had not his Writ of Summons, but was cited as a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal to anſwer; which we before obſerved.</p>
               <p>And this was but neceſſary, that when the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents <hi>in capite,</hi> or Barons, which principally at leaſt made the Parliament, were to be conſulted about ſome arduous Affairs, that they ſhould have notice and a ſolemn intimation thereof, and their preſence required and enjoyned, by Writs to them particularly and perſonally directed.</p>
               <p>Beſides that, it was agreeable to all the forms of Government then in uſe, to have their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and extraordinary Council. For, <hi>Omnes Germanicae Originis Reges atque Imperatores, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici Concilio antiquitùs utebantur, altero ſtatario, qui Senatus dicitur ad res quotidianas, altero evoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, concilium aut conventus ordinum ad res momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti majoris;</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> aſſures us.</p>
               <p>Neither can it be denied by any man of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, who hath heard any thing of the ſtate of our Government before the Conqueſt, and that knows that many ancient Burroughs ſend Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes to Parliament by Preſcription, and will conſider the Records produced by Mr. <hi>Petit,</hi> in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56755:84"/> his very learned and elaborate Book called, <hi>The Ancient Right of the Commons of England,</hi> to prove the Right of ancient Burroughs to ſend Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to Parliament who repreſent them; but that ſuch, though not Suiters to the <hi>Curia Regis,</hi> were Members <hi>de jure</hi> of the great Council of Parliament. But the truth is, they are not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in any Record or Hiſtory of any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the beginning of the Conquerours Reign to the end of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. as a diſtinct part of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> their Numbers and Qualities were little and mean, of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in compariſon to that great Body of the Baronage that conſtituted our Parliaments in that time; but our Parliaments ſeem by the ſtyle uſed in Hiſtories and Records, to be onely the Baronage of <hi>England.

It is obſervable, that the <hi>Barones minores</hi> are ſo mentioned, as if the name of Barons were not to belong to them.

That which was done, was without the Conſent of his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Barons, as appears by a Letter of his to the Pope, in thoſe words recited by Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyt,</hi> in his mentioned Book, <hi>Cum Comites &amp; Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones</hi> Angliae, <hi>nobis devoti eſſent antequam Nos, &amp; noſtram Terram Domino veſtro ſubjicere curaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemus, Extunc in Nos ſpecialiter ob hoc ſicut pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licè dicunt violenter inſurgunt.</hi> And by another Letter of his, to the Pope, recited, p. 163. Wherein he complains of the Biſhops Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience on this Occaſion; which I the rather take notice of, that the Cauſe of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might not be betrayed, by depending upon ſuch weak Inferences as thoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that there was a Houſe of Commons at that time, which did not conſent to the vaſſallating of the Kingdom, by King <hi>John</hi> to the Pope: For that otherwiſe, it could have been validly done. And that, if our preſent Houſe of Commons, in the ſame Form as it is now conſtituted, was not in Being ever after the Conqueſt, it is not therefore an Eſſential part of our Government: For if our Government muſt take its Fate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Iſſues as theſe, I am ſure we ſhall not long hold it. The greateſt Truths are betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by weak Proofs, and the cleareſt Right, ſometimes loſt, by putting it upon an uncertain or improbable Iſſue. This is certain, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thing of Government is introduced by the Conſent of the Prince, and that Alteration aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56755:86"/> to, and embraced, avowed and owned by every man of the Community, by Actions, and other open Declarations of a full Conſent; and this continued for Centuries of Years; and in all that time, applauded, and found agreable to the Intereſt of the Prince and People, and the Old Government aboliſh'd and impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the very matter of its ceaſing; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a thing impoſſible, as well as not deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſtore it. I ſay, whatever Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thus introduced and eſtabliſhed, is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable as unalterable, (or no Government is) as if it had been ever ſo: For there can be no Government in this World that is eternal; how this Change came, we ſhall ſpeak to by and by.</p>
               <p>But for the ſake of Truth, I muſt confeſs, that I have no reaſon to believe, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in all this time, had their Repreſentatives in Parliament, by the formality of a Choice. But this is a great miſtake, that the People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be repreſented, but by ſuch as are from time to time choſen by them; when as every Government is the Repreſentative of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in what they are to be governed by it, and by their Conſent to it in the firſt erecting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they do truſt their Governors with the Rule and Order of their Lives and Eſtates, for the Common-weal: For Government, as well as Law, is <hi>Republicae communis ſponſio,</hi> to uſe <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi>'s Words. I cannot eaſily tell which is more
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56755:87"/> eligible for the aſſuring us of good Men in the Common Council of the Kingdom, whether the Choice, and Deſignation of a Perſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by his Character, and a General Rule, or by the contingent Suffrages of the People: But they are, I am ſure, as much our Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who are appointed thereto by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Government, embraced and conſented to by the People, as thoſe are, whom the People nominate for that purpoſe. I know no reaſon therefore why any ſhould think, that nothing is ſtable in our Government, but what hath been ever ſo, and in the ſame Form; or that any man ſhould be ſo affrighted with the Objection (as if it made our Government ſhake, which ſome ſlight Antiquaries, for little Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Antiquity will ſerve for that purpoſe) <hi>That our Parliament was not at all times ſuch it is at this day.</hi> It ſufficeth to me that it was always materially the ſame. When the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror did innovate his Tenures <hi>in Capite,</hi> and made all men of great Eſtates, Barons; and by their Tenures and Eſtates, Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, we had then ſuch Laws, <hi>quas vulgus elegerit;</hi> and then we had materially our three Eſtates, though not ſo well ſized and ſorted as ſince. I thought fit to ſay this, for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World's being troubled with ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Labors, and to divert thoſe that thus employ themſelves to undertakings more uſeful to the Publick, and advantageous to themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:56755:87"/>
               <p>We had then (I ſay) many great Freeholders in every County, that by their Tenures were Members of Parliament, whereas now we have but two; and though the People did not chuſe them, yet the men of that Order ſeem choſen once for all interpretatively, by the People in their conſent to the Government; and they might be reaſonably preſumed to be faithful to the Commonweal, from their own great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments therein. In this Conſtitution ſcarce any man that was fit to be choſen, but was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Peoples choice a Member of Parliament; as now they have more who are fit to be choſen than they can chuſe. So that the <hi>Barones mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> were then inſtead of Knights of the Shire; and the <hi>Barones majores</hi> Biſhops and Earls did then as now make the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Beſides the <hi>Barones majores</hi> and <hi>minores,</hi> there was at this time a diſtinction between the <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Regis</hi> and <hi>Barones Regni,</hi> which I will here explain, to prevent any miſtake that may grow thereupon, The <hi>Barones Regni</hi> were Barons by Tenure, and made part of the Government by the Conſtitution of the firſt <hi>William;</hi> and ſo in proceſs of time called <hi>Barones Regni,</hi> becauſe they had by continuance of that Conſtitution ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a fixed right to that Honour. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the frequent Wars between the Barons and the Kings at that time, they did omit to ſummon ſome who were Barons by Tenure, and now duly called <hi>Barones Regni</hi> to Parliament,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56755:88"/> and called others to Parliament that had no right to be called <hi>ratione tenurae,</hi> and theſe they called <hi>Barones Regis.</hi> This was ill taken by the Lords, and was one of the occaſions of their War with King <hi>John;</hi> upon which they did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Charter for remedy as followeth; <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes majores Regni ſigillatim ſummoniri faceret.</hi> The truth of this as to the fact will appear by the Hiſtories of thoſe times; and that this is the reaſon of that diſtinction of <hi>Barones Regis</hi> and <hi>Barones Regni,</hi> doth appear by the recited Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King <hi>John,</hi> where the <hi>majores Barones</hi> are called <hi>Barones Regni;</hi> for the Barons were more concerned for the loſing of their Honours, than they were at the communication of the like Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to others, and with reaſon; though all Honours are leſſened by the numbers of thoſe participate of them.</p>
               <p>The inconveniences and miſchiefs of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution were very great and very ſenſible, by making the Government conſiſt of one Order; there was no third to moderate and hold the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. The Honour of the great Nobility was leſſened, by an Equality of Suffrage in the great Council of the Kingdom, yielded to the Tenents <hi>in capite,</hi> and were not ſo concerned to ſupport the Dignity of the Crown for the maintaining their own, which in that Conſtitution could not be great. It had the faults of either Houſe, and the virtues of neither: they preſſed hard upon the King, and were uneaſie and oppreſſive to the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56755:88"/> People: they were not reverent of the Crown, nor tender of common right. The great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provides againſt the Oppreſſions of great men, as it doth for bounding the Prerogative. Our mixt Monarchy was out of tune, by the Ariſtocratical Power of the Baronage, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too exceſſive by the policy of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, by advancing too great numbers to that Dignity, too great to depend upon the Crown, or to be govern'd by it unaſſiſted. That which the firſt <hi>William</hi> intended and deſigned for the eſtabliſhment of his Conqueſt, and of the Peace of the Kingdom, made it very eaſie to afflict bad Princes. But by ſeveral ſteps we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, being taught and inſtructed to it by our Experience, and the ſufferance of great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, ſuch a Repreſentative, that might moſt certainly effect what in all Ages was intended and deſigned, that nothing ſhould be Law or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy juſt, but what the People aſſent to, by which their Perſons and Rights are ſecured and defended, which is the ſole end of Government.</p>
               <p>But evident it is, that this more equal &amp; clear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, which we now enjoy in our Houſe of Commons, grew upon the reducement of the exceſſive number of Barons, ſo great that it made them a Tumult rather than an Aſſembly, and for the reducement of the power of the greater Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons: for in the Parliament of 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. when but 25 Lay Barons were ſummoned, tho' in the 41 year of his Reign he numbered 250 great Baronies in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56755:89"/> 
                  <hi>England,</hi> we find Writs for electing to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>London,</hi> two Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, and Barons for the Cinque-Ports: before that time, none were found, nor any Foot-ſteps of Right for the Counties ſending Knights to Parliament; though there is a clear Right appears for the Burroughs to ſend Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes; which we ſhall ſpeak to afterwards.</p>
               <p>It will not be impertinent, here to add, that the Government of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which runs paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel almoſt to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, found it inconvenient, that all the Tenants in <hi>Capite</hi> ſhould reſort to their Parliaments; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they were reduc'd in this manner; <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Barones Minores,</hi> or Tenants in <hi>Capite,</hi> in every County, chooſe two of ther own num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to Parliaments; which, at this day, they call the Barons for Counties: whereas, all our Free-holders chooſe their Knights of the Shire; and our Elections are not reſtrained to Tenants in <hi>Capite.</hi> And this made it more reaſonable for our Repreſentatives of Shires (together with the Burgeſſes) to become, in proceſs of time, a diſtinct Lower Houſe; whereas, their Barons of Shires ſet together with the Lords, and vote in Common with them. The Knights of the Shire, which made the principal part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of the Commons, having no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Houſe of Peers, or the Baronage of <hi>England;</hi> becauſe, choſen by all the Feee-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders indifferently, though not Tenants <hi>in Capite.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:56755:89"/>
               <p>But to return to our Hiſtory that deduceth the Change of our Government. That ſome great matters for publick Good and Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the peace of the King and Kingdom, was treated of in this Parliament, (they did to be ſure eſtabliſh this new Form of a Parliament) will appear by a Form of a Writ of Summons, to the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> to that Parliament; which I will here tranſcribe. Henricus <hi>Dei gratia, Rex</hi> Angliae, <hi>Dominus</hi> Hiberniae, <hi>&amp; Dux</hi> Aquitaniae, <hi>venerabili in Chriſto patri R. Epiſcopo Dunelmenſi ſalutem.

               </p>
               <p>I ſtrongly incline to believe, That this King did call in the Commons by their repreſentatives, (the <hi>Barones Minores</hi> being diſcharged) to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate between him and his Barons, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came after (to be ſure, however it was before) the ſtanding Repreſentative of the people. Something like this, was before attempted by King <hi>John,</hi> by this Writ of King <hi>John,</hi> the like of which, is not found. <hi>Rex vicecomiti</hi> Oxoniae <hi>ſalutem; praecipimus tibi quod omnes milites Ballivae tuae qui ſummoniti fuerant eſſe apud</hi> Oxoniam <hi>ad nos à die omnium Sanctorum in</hi> 15 <hi>dies venire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias cum armis ſuis, corpora vero Baronum, ſive Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis ſingulariter &amp;</hi> 4 <hi>diſcretos milites de comitatu tuo illuc venire facias ad nos, ad eundem Terminum ad loquendum nobiſcum de Negotiis Regni noſtri; teſte meipſo apud</hi> Written, 11 <hi>die</hi> Novembris. <hi>Dorſ.

His Hopes and Deſires of accompliſhng it, will appear by the Stile of the fore-recited Writ, if compared with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writ of Summons, in a Curſory Form, in the 26th, Year of his Reign, which was thus; Henricus, <hi>&amp;c. Venerabili in Chriſto Patri</hi> Walte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro <hi>Eboracenſi Archiepiſcopo ſalutem; mandamus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis qualenus ſicut &amp; honorem noſtrum pariter &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum

               </p>
               <p>But ſhortly, to deduce the Hiſtory of this Change, (which is but conjectural) under the Authority of Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> in which, nothing is certain, but that the Biſhops continued in the Change of the Baronage in the ſame State of Greatneſs mentioned, the ſame Order had their Writs of Summons continued to them as before; and, though many of the Regular Barons were after omitted to be ſummoned to Parliament, yet not one Biſhop ever wanted his Summons. This Diſcrimination ſhews, That they were now Barons by Writ, as the Lay, Barons were, and for the ſame Reaſon; that is, becauſe Tenures did not now make them Barons. But ſuch only were ſo, who had the King's Writs ſent to them of Summons to Parliament: So that the Biſhops are not now to be reckoned <hi>Barones feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi> or Barons by Tenure, but <hi>Barones reſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptitii,</hi> as all Barons at this day, except thoſe by Patent, which are ſo, without any reſpect to Tenure.</p>
               <p>The Feudal Baronage, as we ſaid, was as large, and as numerous as the Tenures by Knights Service in Chief, which were capable of being multiplyed ſeveral ways, for every
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56755:91"/> part of the Fee however divided, the Services reſerved upon that Fee, that were entire and indiviſible, were to be performed by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proprietors of the ſeveral parts of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Fee.</p>
               <p>The Feudal Baronies beſides, were ambulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not fixed to Families; but aſſignable, as Eſtates, and paſſed with the Lands. Who ſees not, that by this Conſtitution and Nature of Baronage, a great many mean perſons, not agreeable to that high Order, muſt be entitled to it, and ſo in truth it happen'd? And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Diſtinction was made firſt between <hi>Barones Majores, &amp; Barones Minores.</hi> The <hi>Barones mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> ſoon loſt the Title of Barons altogether. This is conjectured, by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> to be before the latter end of King <hi>John</hi>'s Reign, and their legal Stile became <hi>Milites,</hi> or <hi>Libere Tenentes;</hi> which ſome, upon a miſtake, anticipating the Change of the Government, made in <hi>H.</hi> 3. time, think, when they meet with <hi>Milites,</hi> or <hi>Libere Tenentes</hi> in Parliament, they have found Knights of the Shire, choſen for Repreſentatives in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>And, if they reteined the Name and Stile of Barons, it was now but abuſively applyed to them; for, their Baronies were in Truth eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, but as Knights Fees only: and, of this ſort of Barons, there remains ſome to this day.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:56755:91"/>
               <p>This appears by a Paſſage in the grand Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King <hi>John,</hi> made in the latter end of his Reign, as it is in <hi>Mat. Paris</hi> 343. <hi>Ad habendum commune concilium Regni, de auxilio aſſidendo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter quam in tribus caſibus praedict.</hi> (theſe three Caſes of Aid to make the Eldeſt Son a Knight of Aid, to marry the Eldeſt Daughter, and Aid of Ranſome are underſtood Heir, as is plain by the Charter) <hi>Et de ſcutagiis aſſidendis faciemus ſummoneri Archiepiſcopos, Epiſcopos, Abbates, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites &amp; majores Barones Angliae ſigillatim per lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras noſtras. Et praeterea faciemus ſummoneri in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerali omnes alios qui in Capite tenent.</hi> This was one Step to remove theſe <hi>Barones Minores,</hi> from the Dignity of Barons; which by <hi>H.</hi> 3. were quite diſcharged, and never appeared after in Parliaments, except choſen Knights of the Shire.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I find this great Charter of King <hi>John,</hi> not well underſtood by ſeveral conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Writers, nor by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> explained, I will offer my Thoughts, and the rather, becauſe it is not impertinent to our preſent purpoſe. The firſt part to which the part before-recited, doth refer is thus: <hi>Nullum ſcutagium, vel auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium ponam in regno noſtro, niſi per commune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium Regni noſtri niſi ad corpus redimendum, &amp; ad primogenitum filium noſtrum militem faciendum, &amp; ad primogenitam filiam noſtram ſemel maritandum, &amp; ad hoc non fiet niſi rationabile auxilium;</hi> and then follows, <hi>&amp; ad habendum Concilium Regni aliter quam in tribus caſibus praedictis &amp; ſcutagiis
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56755:92"/> aſſidendis, &amp;c.</hi> I conceive, that by the firſt <hi>Commune Concilium,</hi> he means the <hi>Curia Regis;</hi> and that he did grant that out of that Court, he would not impoſe Eſcuage, or aid upon his Tenants, except it were thoſe three Caſes of Aid mentioned: For Eſcuage was then and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſeſſed in that Court, and that properly, as being due by their Tenure, only the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionment there was to be made, which was a proper Office for the King's Tenents amongſt themſelves, until the Statute of 34 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>de Tallagio non concedendo;</hi> in which it was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that no Tallage, or Aid, ſhall be put or levied without the Will and Aſſent of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Biſhops, Earls, Barons, Knights, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, and other Free Commons of the Realm; but for all matters other than thoſe three mentioned Aids and Eſcuage, which were due by Tenure, it ſhould be done by that <hi>Commune Concilium,</hi> that is, his Parliament; and he there declares, how he would have it ſummoned as to his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage, who in that part of his Charter, were to receive their Satisfaction; and for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of ſending Burgeſſes to Parliament, they are likewiſe confirmed in the ſame Charter; and therein provided for. So that I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the <hi>modus Parliamenti,</hi> in King <hi>John</hi>'s Time, was in the ſaid Charter decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>It was probable, that before this Charter, there was ſome Law to declare who thoſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jores
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56755:92"/> Barones</hi> were, and who thoſe Tenants in Chief were, that ſhould be accounted now, no longer Barons; and after the Tenants in chief had loſt the Honor of a particular Summons to Parliament, and the Stile of Barons, it was leſs difficult for thoſe Great Barons, to procure a Law to exclude the reſt wholly from having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Right to ſit in the Parliaments under the name of Tenant in Chief only. And to this purpoſe, doubtleſs, ſaith Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> ſome Law was afterwards made, that none ſhould come to Parliament, as a Baron, (that is, by vertue of his Tenure) but ſuch as ſhould have ſeveral Writs of Summons directed to them; in which number, not only all thoſe of the Ancient and Greater Barons were comprehended; but others to whom Writs ſhould be directed; which is in effect, that no Tenure ſhould any longer make a Baron of the Kingdom; but that the Writ of Summons only ſhould make a Baron.</p>
               <p>It is not improbable for the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, that ſuch Law was made the 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. and farther, for that we find, that the Abbot of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> in the 26 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was diſcharged from being ſummoned to Parliament amongſt other reaſons, that he was not ſummoned to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before 49th. year of <hi>H.</hi> 3. and after that <hi>Interpotalis vicibus;</hi> as if part of the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been that thoſe of the Eccleſiaſticks, who at that time were accounted the <hi>Barones Majores;</hi> ſo declared by having Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56755:93"/> to Parliament, ſhould have Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to Parliament, thence after in Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And herewith agreeth Mr. <hi>Cambden. Brit. fo. Henricus tertius ex tantâ multitudine quae ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſa &amp; turbulenta fuit, optimos quoſque reſcripto ad Comitia Parliamentaria evocaverit, ille enim (ex ſatis antiquo ſcriptore loquor) poſt magnas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbationes, &amp; enormes vexationes, inter ipſum Regem &amp; Simonem de Montfort, &amp; alios Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, motas &amp; ſopitas? ſtatuit &amp; ordinavit quod om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes illi Comites &amp; Barones Regni Angliae quibus ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Rex dignatus eſt brevia ſummonitionum dirige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re venierent ad Parliamentum.</hi>

               <p>SO that it appears clearly, that the Feudal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies about this time were quite diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far, that no man by a feudal Barony had any Right to ſit in Parliament; and thoſe that were feudal Barons before this time, by the Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their Baronies afterwards did not ceaſe to be Barons: But for that the <hi>Majores Barones,</hi> and ſuch as had then Writs of Summons, and were appointed to make the Houſe of Lords for after time, were then Barons by Tenure: It continued an Opinion ſome time, that no man was bound to anſwer ſuch Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; but thoſe that were bound thereto by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56755:93"/> their Tenures; thence it was, that after this Conſtitution, many that were feudal Barons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have taken a Liberty to entail their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies with the Lands that were held <hi>per Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam,</hi> upon the Heirs Males, whereby the Heirs general, or next Heir Female were excluded; and an Heir of the half Blood hath enjoyed the Honor with the Lands by vertue of the Entail. We will trouble the Reader with one Inſtance of this kind; and that is as late as <hi>Q. E. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> Lord <hi>Paget</hi> of <hi>Beaudeſert,</hi> entailed the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies of <hi>Longdon</hi> and <hi>Haywood,</hi> by Fine, which deſcended to <hi>Henry</hi> his Son and Heir, who had <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> his Daughter and Heir died, 11 <hi>Eliz.</hi> after whoſe Death, <hi>Thomas,</hi> Brother, and Heir Male of <hi>Henry,</hi> entered into the Baronies afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and was ſummoned to Parliament. This was allowable, becauſe the Honor of the Name and Family was thereby better ſupported, and the Office of a Baron continued in the Family; and the Duty of it better performed by ſuch direction of the Deſcent.</p>
               <p>And we do alſo obſerve, that after the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of being a Baron from Tenure did ceaſe, the following times kept the Old Form of Speech, <hi>&amp; tenere per Baroniam,</hi> was uſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to denote a man a Baron.</p>
               <p>That the Law is as we have ſaid, appears for that an Iſſue at Law, whether Baron, or not, ought to be tried by the Parliament Records of his Summons and Seſſion there as a Baron,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56755:94"/> and not by the Records of the Exchequer to prove the Tenure. I will not therefore trouble the Reader with what is reported to us in our Year-books, nor my ſelf in reconciling the ſeeming diſagreements there about this matter, onely thus, that the Judges have ſometimes ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>cum vulgo,</hi> and not agreeable to the true notion of the Law, and that they did not judge according to Law in the caſe of <hi>Thomas de Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nival.</hi> But, the Barons being anciently firſt ſo by Tenure did ſo ſtick with the Judges, that they allowed <hi>Thomas de Furnivals</hi> Plea, that he did not hold <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> to diſcharge him from being a Baron, though he had been ſummoned as a Baron, and ſate in ſeveral Parliaments as ſuch. But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p>For that which now made Parliamentary Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons was, the receiving of a Writ of Summons to Parliament. Before the 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. The Biſhops were of the number of thoſe that were <hi>majores Barones,</hi> and had Writs of Summons to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the reſt of the great men, before the making of the Law aforeſaid; and they by this new Conſtitution became Barons for them and their Succeſſors, not by Tenure any longer no more than the great Lay Barons, but by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Writ of Summons, and by the afore remember'd Conſtitution and Law made ſome time about the 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>And though the Lands of the Biſhops in the time of the Conquerour, which were put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56755:94"/> that Tenure, be alienated or exchanged as they might have been, I am ſure if they are not before the Statute of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> put a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon them, yet the Succeſſion of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to their Baronies remains.</p>
               <p>It is a queſtion I know, whether a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop can demand his Writ to Parliament, before the reſtitution of the Temporalities, upon his Conſecration: there are valuable Opinions on both ſides; but if the reſtitution of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities muſt be firſt made, it is I conceive up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other reaſon, than that he is not complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhop before that is done, no more than a Rector is a complete Rector after Inſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Induction be made; though he ought (I conceive) to have his Writ upon Conſecration, becauſe upon vacancy of the See, the Guardian of the Spiritualities uſed anciently to have a Writ of Summons to Parliaments; as Dioceſans themſelves.</p>
               <p>And now the Baronage Secular is affixed to Families, and the Spiritual Baronage to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Succeſſion. And now Birth deſigns the Temporal Baron, and Conſecration of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop deſigns the Spiritual Baron; nay ſingle Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction without Confirmation or Conſecration. If elected onely, they were ſummoned to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the addition of <hi>Electi;</hi> if confirmed and not conſecrated, then they are in the Writ of Summons ſtyled <hi>Electi &amp; Confirmati.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> further tells us, that there never was
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56755:95"/> any that had the Title of a Biſhop in <hi>England,</hi> and of the Kings Creation ſince the <hi>Normans,</hi> but was a Baron of Parliament; and though the Regular Barons, and ſuch of them who had Writs were diſcharged upon their Prayer, and omitted to be ſummoned; Yet the Biſhops by reaſon of their Spiritual Dignity had neceſſarily a right and voice. The <hi>Archiepiſcopi, Comites, Barones, &amp; alii Magnates,</hi> in ancient Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Writs of Summons, do ordinarily expreſs and comprehend the whole Baronage, without naming the Abbots and Priors, which muſt be ſignified by the <hi>alii Magnates.</hi> Which I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note, becauſe the <hi>Folio</hi> Author, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man very eaſie and ready in Inferences, doth conclude, that becauſe ſuch Writs mention <hi>Magnates,</hi> beſides Biſhops, <hi>Comites, &amp; Barones,</hi> (which he too ſuddenly concluded were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of the whole Baronage) doth thence argue, that a Writ of Summons of any man to Parliament doth not make him a Baron; and from thence would have it inferred, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are not ſo, (though they are expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and firſt in order, and cannot in reaſon be reduced to that meanneſs of rate and quality with thoſe that fall under an <hi>Et caetera;</hi>) and from hence would have it concluded, that they may, when the King pleaſeth, be diſmiſt that Houſe, becauſe there were anciently ſome Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees that had Seſſion in Parliament now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:56755:95"/>
               <p>Beſides we do obſerve, that another ſort of great men may be meant by the <hi>alii Magnates,</hi> that is to ſay, famous men of the Clergy, not Biſhops, and other men of great name for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of which there were ſome ſummoned in moſt of the ancient Parliaments, not intended thereby by the King to be made noble, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the ſtate of Baronage; for there were diſtinct clauſes in the Writs of Summons, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Kings purpoſe therein. The Writs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to ſuch as were not intended thereby to be made Barons, as the Judges, Attorney General, Kings Serjeant, &amp;c. was, <hi>Quod interſitis nobiſcum &amp; cum caeteris de Concilio noſtro;</hi> and ſometimes <hi>nobiſcum</hi> onely, <hi>ſuper praemiſſis tractaturi, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrúmque conſilium impenſuri:</hi> whereas that to the Barons was, <hi>Quòd interſitis cum Praelatis, Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natibus, &amp; Proceribus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> obſerves, that cuſtom of ſending Summons to great men (not Biſhops) to Parliament, did ceaſe after the clauſe of <hi>Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientes</hi> (by which Convocations were ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Biſhops to meet with Parliaments) grew in uſe, in the Biſhops Writs of Summons to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Of which excellent Proviſion we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak to hereafter.</p>
               <p>All the Baronage, both Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>de jure</hi> ought to have Summons now to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, without reſpect to Eſtate or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:56755:96"/>
               <p>There is no man now, noble by his Acres, a ſort of Nobility, that this refined Age will not allow of. The King, according to the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>H.</hi> 3. afore-mentioned, may now, by Letters Pattents, or Writ, erect a new ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Barony (as well as hereditary) as was done by <hi>H.</hi> 8. The fifth year of his Reign (for that the Baronage of <hi>England</hi> was now affixed to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Succeſſion, and not to Tenures) he by his Letters Patents did then grant unto <hi>Richard Bamham,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Taveſtock,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> the Abbey being of his Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Patronage, and to the Succeſſors of the ſaid Abbot, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t eorum quilibet qui pro tempore ibidem fuerit Abbas ſit &amp; erit unus de Spiritualibus &amp; Religioſis Dominis Parliamenti noſtri haeredum &amp; Succeſſorum noſtrorum gaudend. honore privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio &amp; libertatibus ejuſdem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the King might well do, becauſe, the Abbot was of his Patronage, and the Succeſſors were therefore to be elected and collated by the King; for, that was the Inducement and Reaſon of Kings and Sovereign Princes advancing Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and great Abbots to the degree of Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, making them members of the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of their Kingdoms and Principalities, as is before obſerved, becauſe ſuch Abbots as the Biſhops, were made always, and appointed by the Sovereign Prince.</p>
               <p>And here we may take notice by the way, of the Reaſon, why the <hi>Epiſcopus Soderenſis,</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:56755:96"/> or, the Biſhop of the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> is not ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd to Parliament, which I ſhall give you in the Words of Sir <hi>H. Spelm.</hi> in his Gloſſary, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronum appellatione non omnes hodie apud nos cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentur Epiſcopi ut pote Soderenſis in inſula Manniâ quod de Rege non tenet immediate at de Comite</hi> Darbiae.</p>
               <p>Nay, it is moſt obſervable, That this Honour of Baronage, or being a Member of the Houſe of Peers, was ſo inſeparable to the Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, after the afore-mentioned new Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Baronage, That the Guardians of the Spiritualties of Biſhopricks in the times of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, and the Vicars General of Biſhops being beyond Sea, were ſummoned to Parliaments by the ſame kind of Writs as the Biſhops were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned. Of this, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> doth aſſure us; Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Honour. 2 <hi>Edit.</hi> fol. 721. But this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour laſted no longer than this legal Subſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Vicarious Power. If they had Right to ſit in that Houſe, in reſpect of their Temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Guardian of the Spirituals, or the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars General, would not have had Writs of Summons to Parliament. But, if the Kingdom had not had a great Opinion of that Order, it would not have been provided, and put in uſe; that in Vacancy of the See, or Abſence of the Biſhop, rather than that great Council would want one Biſhop utterly, or the Intereſt, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Conſent of any that had Epiſcopal Authority, they admitted the Subſtitute, by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56755:97"/> whom that Office was executed and adminiſtred for that Interval only.</p>
               <p>When Baronies were feudal, the perſon, tho' in reſpect of his Land, was noble; his great Eſtate and Intereſt, and the other general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions that attend opulent Fortunes, made the Poſſeſſor noble in his Perſon.</p>
               <p>Anciently the Eſtate; of late, the Diſcent, in the Temporal Baronies; and, the Succeſſion in the Spiritual Baronies, place the perſons reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively in the <hi>Cenſus</hi> and Rank of Baronage: but there is no Nobility but what is perſonal, nor can be in Nature. All the perſons in the ſame Order of the publick <hi>Cenſus,</hi> are of the ſame Quality.</p>
               <p>Neither are Biſhops to be accounted leſs Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, or leſs noble, becauſe they enjoy their Baronies for Life only, no more than a Tenant for Life of an hereditary feudal Barony could be ſo accounted. Feudal Baronies being conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Eſtates were alienable as Eſtates, and as Eſtates would ſuffer Limitations, and admit of particular Eſtates for Life. No man can ſay we had no perſonal Nobility in the time when there was no other Baronage than Feudal. How then can it be ſaid, that the Biſhops Perſons are not noble, though they ſhould be accounted only Barons <hi>Ratione Tenurae,</hi> as certainly they are not in proper ſpeaking, at this day, neither can it be objected againſt their perſonal Nobility, that a Biſhop may be degraded; for, ſo may a Peer
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56755:97"/> for more Reaſons than a Decay of his Fortune and Eſtate.</p>
               <p>Which matter, I the rather inſiſt upon, for that the great Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> committed an Error, by not conſidering, that the ways and means, by which, perſons derive and come to be of the Order of the Nobility and Baronage, can make no Difference in the Baronage; but, thence he offers a Reaſon (which muſt needs be a Miſtake too) why Biſhops ſhall not be tryed by Peers, in Capital Crimes, becauſe theſe are perſonal; and, his being a Baron, is <hi>Ratione tenurae,</hi> and not of perſonal Nobility. But this he wrote when he was young, in his firſt Edition of Titles of Honour, which was in the time of King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, can there be a harſher and more incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing ſaid, than that there is any other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility than what is perſonal? Can Land be noble?</p>
               <p>This that I have ſaid, is to prove, That the Spiritual Lords are of the Baronage of <hi>England,</hi> ſuch as it is now conſtituted; and, they do not, cannot remain in any Reaſon or Underſtanding, Feudal Barons, after the <hi>Ratio Baronagii</hi> is changed, and if they could remain Barons <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one tenurae</hi> at this day; yet, they ought to have all Preheminencies and Priviledges of Barons.</p>
               <p>But, true it is, that they are another ſort of Nobility, different from that of the ſecular Lords (though equal in all the powers of Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; and beſides, have precedency in Honour) and therefore make a diſtinct State from them, and one of the three Eſtates, or <hi>Ordines Regni.</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:56755:98"/> Beſides that, by the way, we have deſtroyed the Force of the Arguments uſed by the <hi>Folio,</hi> againſt the <hi>Jus Paritatis</hi> of Biſhops, and their Competency to try a Lay Peer, which we ſhall ſpeak to more by and by.</p>

               <p>IN the King, and in theſe three Eſtates, is placed the Peoples Security, and the Care of the whole Community: from every of them they have diſtinct, juſt, and reaſonable Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though the third State of the Houſe of Commons, hath carried away, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed the name of the Peoples Repreſentatives, though they are only the Peoples Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to act for them, in matters wherein the People are left at perfect Liberty; and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, there is no Order taken in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Government.</p>
               <p>This is truly <hi>Our Government, a King, and Three Eſtates,</hi> the <hi>Lords Spiritual,</hi> the <hi>Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi> and the <hi>Commons,</hi> by their Delegates and Repreſentatives for the purpoſe only to treat about matters, in which, the People have Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to deliberate, and are, and ought to be redreſs'd.</p>
               <p>This is the Forme of all the Modern and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick</hi> Governments, planted in Chriſtian <hi>Europe. Guntherus</hi> expreſſeth three Eſtates thus:
<q>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:56755:98"/>Praelati, Proceres, miſſiſque Potentibus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The great men of Eſtates, <hi>Proceres,</hi> were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to take care of their Intereſts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, which made the Body of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But then there were Cities or great Towns, in which were great Bodies of Freemen, men of Wealth and Trade, that were little concerned in Lands or Tenures, which we call <hi>Liberi Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi,</hi> which our Neighbors call <hi>Hans Towns:</hi> And our Kings ſeem to have by Prerogative a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing Power to declare Towns, when they arrive to be great, peopled, and rich, <hi>Free Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs;</hi> and thereupon they acquire a Right to ſend Delegates to Parliament: And this appears, for that many Boroughs that ſend Burgeſſes of to Parliament, have no other Foundation Right, but the King's Charter; in which he grants, <hi>Sit</hi> A. <hi>de Caetero liber Burgus,</hi> I have ſeen ſome of theſe Charters as ancient as King <hi>John.</hi> Theſe Charters could have had no ſuch Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by vertue of ſome Ancient Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Government: We have no Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its Commencement. King <hi>William</hi> I. that he might have the aſſiſtance of all the States in Parliament, put the Boroughs under Tenure by Baronage. How many of the Burgage Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures were of that ſort, we know not; but it is probable, all that at that time ſent Burgeſſes to the Parliamentary Conventions (by what name ſoever they were then called) the Burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Cinque-ports, are ſtill called Barons.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56755:99"/> And we know, that the Borough of St. <hi>Albans</hi> was put under that Tenure, and in that Right challenged them to Burgeſſes to Parliament, as Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> acknowledgeth. But the reaſon why we have no remembrance of the Tenures of Boroughs to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament, is that which we have here proved, <hi>viz.</hi> the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon of Baronage, <hi>viz.</hi> by Tenure, did ceaſe about the time of <hi>H.</hi> 3. And conformably the King might require Boroughs to ſend Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to Parliament, without mentioning in his Writs the duty of their Tenure; and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring them free Boroughs, give them that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, though not oblig'd thereto, by any Tenure created upon them. So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that before <hi>H.</hi> 3. our great Councils, or Parliaments conſiſted of three Eſtates, though they all paſs'd under the general Stile of <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagium Angliae;</hi> which I thought fit to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that our Parliaments, or great Council of the Realm always conſiſted of three States,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> From this, that the King's Prerogative being ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> to have power to declare Free Boroughs, which he uſeth by his Letters Patents: The Rights of choſing their Burgeſſes to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, belongs to all of the Community, and cannot be reſtrain'd to fewer Electors by their Charters: For <hi>Jura ordinaria non recipiunt modum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Remainder at leaſt of this Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, continued in all the Countries where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>German</hi> Colonies made their Conqueſts,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56755:99"/> and planted themſelves, as will appear to any body that will conſult the Republicks, and thoſe plentiful Quotations that hath been made by a Learned Author in his Book, publiſhed ſince this was written.</p>
               <p>I cannot but wonder, ſince this our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution hath been oftenmoſt authentickly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and every one knows, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is materially ſo as we have ſaid; and it is agreed by all, that the Government conſiſts of three States; that yet we know not where to find 'em.</p>
               <p>There is much Art uſed to give Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to, or rather to form an Opinion that the King is one of the three States. It is now almoſt come to be an Opinion; and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is an Opinion, it is an Error. This Error, ſuch as it is, is endeavored to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the Deſtruction of the Government. It is nurs'd up carefully, and is to gain Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Credit with the People, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of great Names; and when it is grown popular, it is deſigned to take the leaſt next Advantage againſt the Spiritual Lords, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs them from their Bench, as no neceſſary, or eſſential part of the Government.</p>
               <p>There was, it's true, an ill-pen'd and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Addreſs, made by the Houſe of Commons only to the the King in 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. to deſire him to make Peace between the Lords, and therein they ſay, that the three States of Parliament,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56755:100"/> are the King, the Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Commons: But this is the firſt time, that an Addreſs of a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was ſo nicely conſidered: And that the Form and Letter of it ſhould be the meaſure of Law and of the Government. There was alſo a phantaſtick Letter, written by <hi>Stephen Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> printed it ſeems in the Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> wherein that Biſhop talks of three States, in which he muſt needs reckon the King for one: For he could not leave him out of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and he had no more Chriſtian Graces than Faith, Hope and Charity, which he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to this Ternary of States of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. But if he had four of thoſe Graces, there had been four States, if ſix of thoſe Graces, to have match'd them in number, he would have found three States in the Houſe of Commons, <hi>viz.</hi> Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes, and have made ſix States.</p>
               <p>It ſeems too, King <hi>James</hi> made a Speech in Parliament, wherein he was pleaſed to uſe his Logick; and liked, it ſeems, the <hi>Ramiſtical</hi> way of <hi>Dichotomies.</hi> The truth is, he had more Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick than a wiſe King could tell how to beſtow. For in that Speech, he ſaith, The Parliament is compoſed of a Head and a Body, himſelf and the Parliament. This Body is ſub-divided into two parts, the upper Houſe, and the lower Houſe. The upper Houſe into two, Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal; the lower Houſe into
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56755:100"/> two, Knights and Burgeſſes. The Citizens were left out for the ſake of his <hi>Dithotomy.</hi> His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was to proceed by the way of two's; and therefore 'twas impoſſible we ſhould here in this Speech of any three whatſoever; yet this Speech too, is produced againſt three States di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the King.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they tell us, that in one of the late King's Declarations, drawn by (then) a young Gentleman, but of great hopes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a very great Man; the King is called one of the three States. This Gentleman was very probably miſled into that Miſtake, by a Book called <hi>Nomotechnia;</hi> wherein it is ſaid, that the King, Lords and Commons are the three States: a Book of Inſtitutions for young Students, which was never yet allowed for Authority in the Law; nor ever had the Honor to be cited in our Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Miſtakes, or whatever you will call them with the Authority of the <hi>Octavo</hi> Author, are united together to form an Opinion, that the King is, but the Biſhops are not one of the three States, which will be a very diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Error: For that it will lead us into a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of our Government; and which is much worſe, for that it hath a tendency to ſubvert it, that is, to depreſs the King, and to ſuppreſs the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>It is an Indign thing, and not to be ſuffer'd, that we ſhould loſe our Government by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reption, and be made a <hi>Babel,</hi> by dividing and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56755:101"/> confounding our Language. To prevent this miſchief, we have declared our Government, from the very Reaſon and Nature of the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture thereof, to conſiſt of three States, that is, three different Orders, which make the Great Council of the Kingdom; whoſe End and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is, to adminiſter Council and Auxiliaries to the King, who is intruſted with the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power of the Government and Laws. And beſides, now we will produce great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, to put this Miſtake out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to prevent its gaining any farther Authority with the People.</p>
               <p>For Errors of this nature, in proceſs of time, turn into Truth, and things prove to be ſo at laſt, as the Error and Miſtake firſt beſpake them; and this our Lawyers know well enough, with whom 'tis a <hi>Maxime</hi> (it belongs only to them, and matters within their Province) <hi>Communis Error facit Jus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, for this purpoſe, we will mention the Stile that the Parliament uſed, which was convened by the Authority of <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he being then about to relinquiſh the Crown to <hi>H.</hi> 4. This Parliament, in tranſacting ſo weighty an Office, had reaſon to conſider and know who they themſelves were. They, without doubt, in all their Proceedings in this High Matter, uſed their true, as well as biggeſt Stile, which was that of <hi>States. Walſingham</hi> tells us, <hi>Sede Regali tunc vacua Procurators Regis</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:56755:101"/> Richardi, <hi>Archiepiſcop. Eborac. &amp; Hereford. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciationem dicti Regis &amp; ceſſionem omnibus ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus Regni tunc adunatis ibi publice declararunt</hi> And again, <hi>Quoniam videbatur cunctis Regni ſtatibus ſuper dictis Articulis ſingulatim, ac etiam communiter interrogatis.</hi> And again, <hi>Ordinati ſunt Comiſſarii ex parte ſtatuum &amp; Communitatis ejuſdem Regni.</hi> Obſerve here, that the King is none of theſe States; that they are called all the States, which ſignifies more than two; that there is mention of States, beſides Community; and therefore, it was then underſtood, that there were two States in the Lords Houſe.</p>
               <p>But afterwards he recites us the Form of a moſt important Inſtrument, which follows, <hi>In Dei nomine, Amen, Nos,</hi> I. <hi>Epiſc. Aſſavenſis,</hi> I. <hi>Abbas Glaſconienſis, Thomas Comes Gloceſtriae, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Dominus de Berkley, Tho. de Epingham, Tho. Gray Miles, Willielmus Thirning Juſticiarius, per Pares &amp; Proceres Regni Angliae Spirituales &amp; Temporales, &amp; ejuſdem Regni Communitates, omnes ſtatus ejuſdem Regni Repreſentantes Commiſſarii, ad infra ſcripta ſpecialiter deputati, &amp;c.</hi> By which it is moſt clear, that the Government was then underſtood to conſiſt of three <hi>States,</hi> of which the King was none, as he cannot be with any Congruity.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. <hi>Rot. Parl. apud Weſtm. die Veneris</hi> 23 <hi>Jan.</hi> it appears, that a Bill was exhibited <hi>coram Dom. Rege in Parl.</hi> Wherein is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That ſeveral Articles on the behalf, and in the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56755:102"/> name of the three States of the Realm,</hi> viz. <hi>Lords Spiritual, Temporal, and Commons, were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the King.</hi> And farther, that the ſaid three Eſtates were not aſſembled in form of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; therefore be it ordained by this preſent Parliament, that the Tenor of the ſaid Articles, delivered as aforeſaid, on the behalf of the ſaid three Eſtates out of Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now by the three Eſtates aſſembled in this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, be the ſame ratified and approved, <hi>Ac idem Dominus Rex de aſſenſu dictorumtrium ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum Regni &amp; Authoritate praedicta, omnia &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula praemiſſa, in billa praedicta contenta concedit, &amp; ea pro vero &amp; indubio pronunciat, decernit, ac declarat.</hi> This was in like manner, an Act of Parliament, for declaring the Right of the Crown to be in <hi>Rich.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>In the Statute made 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. the Word <hi>State</hi> is uſed plurally, and for more than two, of which the King was none, to ſignifie the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as appears <hi>cap,</hi> 15. And ſo it is alſo in 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. in which theſe words are, <hi>Sith it is the deſire of all the States of the Realm, that nothing ſhall be ſo demanded of our Sovereign the King. He will that all thoſe who make any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> &amp;c. So that hereby it is evident, that in the Underſtanding of that time, there were three States beſides the King. But to ſpare the Reader the trouble of the mentioning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords at large, that teſtifie the Parliament to conſiſt of the King and the three Eſtates, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:56755:102"/> Lords Spiritual, Lords Temporal, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, I will refer them that doubt to the Collection made in Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi>'s <hi>Index</hi> to Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Cotton</hi>'s Abridgment, under that Title (who himſelf was of this Opinion, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Evidence of the truth of the thing could have form'd: His great Knowledge in Records; and that he is known, not to be partial for the Biſhops, make him of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>pages</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 329, 384, 325, 281, 392, 567, 607, 710, 712, 713, 714.</p>
               <p>And farther, in the Time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in an Act of Parliament, in the firſt Year of her Reign, made for the Recognition of Her Queen of <hi>England;</hi> which was an Act of State, and of the whole Community; and therefore moſt requiſite it was, that that Parliament ſhould give themſelves their right Stile. It is ſaid, <hi>We your ſaid</hi> (the Lords Spiritual, Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Commons in Parliament aſſembled, was ſaid before, to which this doth relate) <hi>moſt loving Subjects, repreſenting the three States of your Realm of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>The Nature of the Government came direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their Times, under Conſideration of the Parliament, which is an Aſſembly that cannot be miſtaken in the Conſtitution of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in any Queſtion of ſuch a Nature, when they will deliberate and conſider. This migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Affair required them to conſider who they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56755:103"/> were, and what was their Conſtitution. Now (if at any time) they are to uſe that Stile, that denotes their Power, and declares the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Stile of the three <hi>Eſtates</hi> of the Realm, it ſeems, is ſo ſacred and great, and not for ordinary uſe, but that it is uſed upon ſuch occaſions as the Recognition of the Sovereign Princes, and in declaring Kings. This Stile is moſt certain declarative of the true Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the great Stile and Title of the Lords Spiritual, Lords Temporal, and Commons of <hi>England.</hi> A <hi>Miſnomer</hi> now would be as great a Soleciſm, as to ſee the Nobles and Prelates without their Robes, and proper Cognizances, at the Solemnities of a Coronation.</p>
               <p>By the due comparing the Statutes aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiond, wherein the Lords Spiritual, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and Commons are called the States, and alſo the Repreſentatives of all the Eſtates of the Kingdom. We may be enlightened into a great Miſtery of State; for that the Lords Spiritual, and the Lords Temporal, and Commons, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the three States; and alſo the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the States give us to underſtand, that every one of them is entruſted for the other; and with the Conſervancy of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and are all in their proper Miniſtries deſigned to the Common Good; and each of them have Dependencies and Expectancies from the other, in the due Diſcharge of their proper and diſtinct Offices. And that the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56755:103"/> and the Lords Temporal are Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives and Truſtees, for the Peoples Good, and the Common-weal, as well as their own. In like manner, as every Parliament man, for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Borough, is a Repreſentative of all the Commons of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we will adjoyn another great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that is of Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> 4 <hi>Inſt. fol.</hi> 2. who tells us, that the King and three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, <hi>viz.</hi> Lords Spiritual, and Lords Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Commons, are the great Corporation and Body Politick of this Nation. This was the Opinion of his Old Age, when he was moſt improved in Knowledge; and when he did not flatter the Prerogative.</p>
               <p>Beſides, to clear this point, we may obſerve, that the Stile of Acts of Parliament, that hath moſtly obtained, is this, <hi>viz, Be it enacted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and by, and with the Advice and Conſent of the Lords Spiritual, and Lords Temporal, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> This diſtinct mention of the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal, is Cognizance of their being diſtinct <hi>States:</hi> For obſerve, there is no particular mention of Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, in Acts of Parliament; becauſe they are all of the Commonalty, which is but one State. They are all involved under the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Name of Commons: And ſo would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lords, both Spiritual, and Temporal have been in the general Name of Lords, if they had not been diſtinct States, and ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56755:104"/> The Stile of Acts of Parliament, would have been by the Advice and Aſſent of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament: And the ancient Stile of Parliament, before the Houſe of Commons was divided and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted apart from the Lords Houſe, was <hi>Clerus &amp; Populus, Clerus &amp; Magnates;</hi> as may be ſeen by <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> and <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> and the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of thoſe Times: So that the <hi>Clerus,</hi> or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, were always a diſtinct State in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>For the letting in Light upon all that hath been ſaid in this matter; and for farther clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and to reconcile the Differences in the Stiles of the Parliament; and that they may u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in their Evidence, and not ſeem to thwart one another: It muſt be remembred, that that which is moſt expreſs and particular, is moſt ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entifical, and more exactly inſtructive, moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and true; and intends to inform us exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the very Nature of the thing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be derogated from, nor prejudiced by what is more general, or leſs diſtinct.</p>
               <p>It is hence therefore evident, that the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, are taken for diſtinct States, as they are: For they have their diſtinct Intereſts, and for ſeveral ends and purpoſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came parts in the Government. They have their ſeveral Miniſtries and Advantages to the Government apart, and come into that Houſe, by ſeveral ways of Deſignation and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56755:104"/> The Prelates care, beſides that which is common between them and the Temporal Lords, is that of Religion, and the Affairs of the Church, and the whole Order Eccleſiaſtical, by which the People are to be miniſtred to in their higheſt Concernments; which are Reaſons very ſufficient to reckon and account them a diſtinct State.</p>
               <p>And now we have aſſerted to the Prelates a <hi>Jus Paritatis</hi> in the Houſe of Lords, for that they are complete Barons, as we have likewiſe proved them a diſtinct State.</p>
               <p>The Baronage of <hi>England</hi> is the Houſe of Lords. Additions of Title give Precedency, but no Superiority or addition of Power. The Baronage is one Order and Rank, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the <hi>Cenſus</hi> of the Government, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Promotion, the Ends and Intereſts of the Government in the advancement of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, though ſeveral from thoſe that advanced the Temporal Lords to their State and Honour; yet to the ſame degree they are promoted, they are both Members of the ſame great Council, of the ſame great Judicature, and are therefore by their long continuance moſt duely ſtyled <hi>Pares Regni.</hi> And moreover the Biſhops are conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to their Order and Office Eccleſiaſtical, and another care incumbent upon them beſides that of the Baronage; and the Orders that belong to the conſideration of Heralds do ſignifie, that their Office of a Biſhop doth not leſſen the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Peerage.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:56755:105"/>
               <p>What is it then that makes this preſent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? The Biſhops have the reaſon and nature of the Government of their ſide, they have uſed ſuch a power when they have pleaſed, it was never denied to them, and their right hath had the moſt ſolemn Recognition that can be made.</p>
               <p>The Canon could not abridge and reſtrain their right, and their true Character qualifies them not onely to the degree of an unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Judge, but renders them moſt fit and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For beſides their Wiſdom and Juſtice, common with that of the Temporal Lords, they are intended of the greateſt tenderneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and muſt be ſo if they comport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with agreeableneſs to their Character and Function.</p>
               <p>They are not ordinarily engaged in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Temporal Grandees, and Religion being their buſineſs, they are more under the powers of it; that being their glory and their firſt greatneſs, that which promoted them to their Secular Honour and Dignity, and that which muſt ſupport it. Their Intereſt is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and therefore they are the more obliged in all their outward acts to comport with it. They, out of an univerſal charity, underſtand, that it is mercy and compaſſion to the innocent to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the nocent perſon; and yet they can, in the adminiſtration of punitive Juſtice, attemper the ſeverities of Laws with the mercies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and uſe Compaſſion to the Criminal, when
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56755:105"/> they do not depart from the unrelenting Rules of Law out of regard to the publick peace: and by ſuch demeanour they may reconcile the Office of a Judge with that of a Prieſt, which ſome have thought incompatible. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>AND ſuch a Judge would I chuſe; but we we muſt take ſuch a Judge as the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points. <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is objected againſt the Biſhops right in the queſtion, which ſaith, that <hi>Nullus liber homo capiatur, &amp;c. nec ſuper eum ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, nec ſuper eum mittemus niſi per judicium pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſuorum.</hi> The Objector omitted to add or conſider what follows, <hi>viz. Aut per legem terrae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is no Literal Law, as every body knows, but intending to confirm the Common Law, it is upon the matter <hi>Lex non ſcripta;</hi> it alters nothing that was the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56755:106"/> Common Law before, but that being found out declares what <hi>Magna Charta</hi> eſtabliſheth. And therefore Peers ſhall be tried by Commoners in Appeals, notwithſtanding the Letter of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> for otherwiſe Peers could not be tried at all, nor no Juſtice done in Appeals, which is the Suit of the Party and not of the King. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege muſt be always ſet aſide, rather than a faileur of Juſtice ſhall be allowed. So that the Law before <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and ſince, whatſoever it was, muſt determine this matter.</p>
               <p>The Proviſions that the Law hath made, that the Nobles and the Commonalty ſhall not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle to judge any perſons, not of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is a moſt prudent Eſtabliſhment, without which neither Order, Juſtice, or Peace could be preſerved. The Envy of the Commons would render them unfit Judges of the Peers; and the Animoſities of the Peers would render them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to ſit in Judgment upon a deſpiſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner.</p>
               <p>Beſides that, otherwiſe the Dignity of the Order of Peers would ſuffer, for the Superiour can no more be judged with any congruity, than bleſſed by the Inferiour. This is a reaſon big and wiſe enough to be aſſigned, and worthy of a wiſe Government and Polity. And to this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the words of the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>de Proditoribus,</hi> do point, <hi>De ceo ſoit probablement attaint de overt fait per gens de lour condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:56755:106"/>
               <p>And therefore it ſeems to me, that according to the Reaſon and Deſign of the Law, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Law in particular Caſes, that Biſhops being Barons, and of the Peerage of <hi>England</hi> and of that Rank and Order, they ought to be, tryed by thoſe of their own Condition: And the denial to them of this Priviledge, which is annex'd to, and is a reſultance from the Dignity of their Order, is a departure from <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and not agreable to the Proviſion of the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>But it was never an allowable Exception to a Judge, that the Judge hath not ſo good an Eſtate, or other Advantages of Fortune, equal to the man he Judges, to forfeit, in caſe the Judge be a Capital Offender; upon which reaſon, the <hi>Folio Gentleman</hi> grounds his Reaſonings againſt the Biſhops being Tryers of Peers. He argues the Biſhops incompetent to try a temporal Baron upon this reaſon; becauſe the Biſhop hath only a Peerage for his Life to forfeit.</p>
               <p>But who can be ſatisfied with ſuch fine and ſlender Reaſoning, or entertain an Opinion that is not bettern grounded?</p>
               <p>I would not be thought to argue or maintain, that Prelates are ſo fit to be appointeed by the King's Commiſſion, to try a Temporal Peer, in the Court of a Lord High Steward, out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: when a ſelect Number of Peers are to be appointed for Tryal, it is moſt convenient, that thoſe of the ſame Species of the Baronage,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56755:107"/> ſhould be choſen for that purpoſe, for many reaſons: but for a Tryal of a Temporal Peer in Parliament, which is the Eſtabliſhment and Appointment of the Governmnt, and not of the King's ſpecial Deſignation (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon of the <hi>Folio</hi>) for Reaſons herein alleadged, a Biſhop is a moſt fit, legal, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge.</p>
               <p>But I have taken too much notice already of the Errors and Miſtakes of the <hi>Folio,</hi> and his falſe Reaſonings; I am weary of ſuch Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions: I ſhall proceed now to the end of my Diſcourſe; without making any more Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>It is already cleared, that the Biſhops are compleat Barons, that they are of the State of the Baronage; and it can have no Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how they came by it, nor how they held it for the <hi>Modus tenendi,</hi> doth not alter or diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifie the Honor.</p>
               <p>And for my part, I cannot find reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but that the Biſhops had, or might have had originally their Tryals, by Peers; and that it was their Right in Conſequence of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed in that Order and State (beſides that they have a Precedency to the Temporal Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage) to be tried by the Baronage, becauſe the Law for the reaſon afore-mentioned, appoints Tryals <hi>per Pares.</hi> But the contrary practice is the Strength of our Adverſaries, in oppoſing the Peerage of Biſhops, which we ſhall therefore now conſider of.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:56755:107"/>
               <p>It is certain, that in all Tryals, wherein Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are concerned, whether Plaintiffs, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, in Actions real, as well as perſonal, whether the Lands of the Church are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not, a Knight is to be returned upon the Jury, that is, to try the Iſſue. I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Reader with Law Caſes, any Gentleman that pleaſeth may examine the Truth of what I ſay.</p>
               <p>This priviledge therefore cannot be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Lands of the Biſhoprick (as the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> would have it) but of the perſons of the Biſhops, a reſpect to the Order and Peerage of the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>It is the ſame Priviledge, and as large as the Temporal Peers enjoy in this matter, which is, that the worthieſt and beſt of the Commoners, which are Knights, ſhould be impannelled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Jury, where either a Spiritual or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Baron is concern'd; beſides that, I find a ſingle Remembrance as high, as 13 <hi>E.</hi> 3. in <hi>Brooks</hi> Tryal 142. (the Reports of that year are not printed) of the Biſhops Right of Peerage in a Capital Cauſe; the Book is <hi>Eveſque eſt Peere de Realme, &amp; ſerva try per Peres in Crime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how this Right came to be diſcontinued, and to loſe remembrance, we ſhall preſently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for; but I cannot think it Sence, which ſome of our Lawyers have ſaid for this purpoſe, that a Biſhop, his being a Baron, is <hi>Ratione Tenurae,</hi> and not perſonal; which is all one as to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56755:108"/> ſay, that the Biſhop is a Baron, but his Perſon is not a Baron; but his Peerage and Baronage, is no other in truth, than an Honor accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Perſon of a Biſhop, together with his Office.</p>
               <p>But to excuſe them, they thought themſelves obliged to give a reaſon why Biſhops are not (as the Law is taken) to be tryed by Peers, but by a Common Jury, which grew into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice by accident, and was not ever ſo in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but certainly is very irregular, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream incongruous; and therefore to give a good reaſon, for it is too hard a task to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; and he that will undertake to give a reaſon of that which is unreaſonable, and go about to prove a thing fit which is incongruous, muſt likely ſpeak things equally incongruous, abſurd and unreaſonable.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak what the truth is in this matter, the Biſhops and the whole Order of Clergy did challenge to be exempt from the Juriſdiction of Secular Courts; but the Biſhops, as is objected, never waved their <hi>jus paritatis,</hi> upon Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in inferior Courts. They only never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon it: For they had a better way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, by ſetting up the pretended Rights and Priviledges of their Order, and that Church, for exempting themſelves from the Juriſdiction of the Temporal Courts; and by this means, they did eſcape unpuniſhed for the moſt part.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:56755:108"/>
               <p>Though there were ſeveral Abatements made by the proviſion of the Laws, and the Wiſdom of the Judges, to their unreaſonable pretences therein; yet they always got off by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended priviledge, if not with impunity, yet with ſome protection at leaſt from Juſtice; and farther they thought perhaps they might at leaſt avoid being thought guilty of the Crimes obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, whilſt they uſed this pretence for a reaſon why they would not make a Defence.</p>
               <p>And ſure in all Offences but Treaſon, they eſcaped with their Lives before the Statutes that took away the benefit of Clergy, in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the greateſt Guilt, and even in the Caſe of Treaſon, the Criminal ever had the Advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Interceſſion of the Church-power and Intereſt, becauſe the priviledge they contended for, was ſo great and valuable a Concernment (as they eſteem'd it) to the Order of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</p>
               <p>But by this means, the memory of the Uſe of this Right and Priviledge was loſt, and the Deteſtation of a Crime in a Prelate, provided him a ſpeedy and ready Juſtice, ſuch as was at hand; and at length, Biſhops themſelves, unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly, and being born down by the Common Opinion thus grounded and occaſioned, did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Tryals by Juries.</p>
               <p>It is enough to have given an account, how this Anamolous piece of Law came about. But Anamolous Caſes never make Rules, nor deſtroy
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56755:109"/> any. Nor is it to be drawn into conſequence, whatever is a departure from the Eſtabliſhment to deſtroy it quite. Poſitive Conſtitutions, of which no Reaſons can be given why they are ſo, can infer or argue nothing. Reaſon cannot make Law, though it is a fair inducement: but our Reaſon is moſt perverſly imployed, when it proceeds from the Irregularities that happen in Human Affairs, and are ſhuffled upon us by length of time by violence and iniquity, and a heap of Accidents to argue us into more, and to refix that which is regular, and remains firm. <hi>In quo quis peccat, in eo punietur.</hi> Is it not enough, that the Order now ſuffers a diminution of their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by reaſon of the contumacy of the Popiſh Prelates their Predeceſſors, and that their Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to ſubmit to Temporal Juſtice are viſited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Succeſſion? Severe enough this is in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould any man expect, that this Age in conſequence of this ſhould be perſuaded, and reaſoned to exclude the Biſhops out of their remaining right? 'Tis no more to be expected, than that a man that hath one hand withered and mortified with the Palſie, ſhould be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to cut off the other for conformity.</p>
               <p>We know how the Prelates fell from their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Dignity, of being tried by thoſe of their own Order, and were ſubmitted to be tried by Juries of Commoners. It would be therefore conſonant and agreeable to the Dignity of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56755:109"/> and Lords of Parliament, (for ſuch the Biſhops are) that they be reſtored to their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent right in the matters of Trials, as miſtaken Law is rectified by an Act of Parliament. A wiſe Act of State it would be, to redintegrate the Honour of the Baronage of <hi>England,</hi> the whole Baronage ſuffering diſhonour by a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſo Honourable a Privilege in one of the <hi>membra dividentia</hi> of that body, whileſt the Biſhops are thrown to common Jurors. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the incongruity thereof hath given occaſion to ſome men, to queſtion one another of the <hi>jura paritatis,</hi> which belongs to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and to diſpute their right of Seſſion in that Houſe, in one of the moſt important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the Government.</p>
               <p>But however this Irregularity is diſcourſed, it doth not affect the Right of the Prelates now in diſpute; for though Biſhops are tried by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners out of Parliament, as the Law is now ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taken; yet that they are to be tried by Peers in Parliament our Adverſaries do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And that they may and ought to ſit in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Temporal Lords in Parliament in Capital Cauſes, we have clearly proved. So that the Reciprocal of a Biſhops being judged and judging in Capital Cauſes in Parliament is intire, and in this they continue duly <hi>pares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that it may not depend upon our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Conceſſions, that Biſhops may be tried by Peers in Parliament; for he is not always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56755:110"/> to himſelf, and may take back what he hath yielded; we ſhall here ſubjoyn a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative proof, that the Biſhops ought to be tried by Peers in Parliament. And that they have been declared and taken for Peers, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Character tried; when if they had not been reckoned and deemed Peers, they could not have received Tryal in Parliament; and it is thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the Third had prevailed with the Lords againſt their good will to condemn the Earl of <hi>March;</hi> Sir <hi>Simon Beresford, John Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trevers, Boys de Boyons, John Devard, Thomas de Gowrney, William Ogle,</hi> for the Murder of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Second his Father and the Earl of <hi>Kent;</hi> all of them Commoners but the Earl of <hi>March.</hi> The Lords were afterwards ſenſible of the Injuſtice and Irregularity of their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in judging and condemning Commoners; and for the avoiding of the like for time to come, an Act of Parliament was made which followeth, <hi>viz.

               <p>To compleat our Argument, the <hi>Concordia</hi> appears now an Act of Parliament to the purpoſe, that the Lords ſhould not give Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others than their Peers; yet we find the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops afterwards judged in Parliament, and that in times near the making of this Act, when we may be allowed to preſume they knew this Law (and beſides the practice hath been conformable to the Law, ſince, as our Adverſary confeſſeth) and particularly to mention no more, the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in the 7 <hi>R.</hi> 2. And <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. both for Treaſon, were tryed in Parliament, by Peers; which Caſes are before mentioned to another purpoſe.</p>
               <p>There was likewiſe an Act of Parliament, made 13 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 7. that the Nobles of the Land ſhould not be put to anſwer, but in open Parliament, by their Peers: but two years after that Act was repealed; otherwiſe we ſhould not have ſince heard of Tryals of Biſhops by common Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Capital Cauſes. And when the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peers can again procure and provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch a Law, they will not, I hope, envy the Biſhops, if they find them therein included.</p>

               <p>BUt after all that hath been ſaid, it will be yet neceſſary to advertiſe the Reader for informing and ſettling a true Judgment of the Right of the Cauſe, that in Queſtions of this Nature, we can only arrive to a moral Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is made by incomparably the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt probability. That we cannot be anſwered, but by producing ſomething, at leaſt, equally probable to all the ſeveral parts of our Diſcourſe that are to the queſtion, if by any Objection they ſhould render any one part of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe doubtful, they would do nothing, except they can do ſo to all the reſt; which can be done only by offering ſomething more probable. For when many probabilities are concurring to prove the ſame thing, they do not ſingly ſtand upon their own Credit; but they are all aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Conjunction, and give Aids mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ſupport every one ſingle probability. This is but neceſſary to be ſaid, for that I ſee this Queſtion will be kept up and defended, with Obſtinacy, Paſſion, Intereſt, and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Contention.</p>
               <p>And farther, that it is very undecent, that a queſtion of this Greatneſs, concerning a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grave and important, ſhould be endleſly
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56755:112"/> vexed with trifling Objections of the <hi>Nequam ingenioſi.</hi> To prevent therefore the Caprice, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Cavillations, trifling Criticiſms, forcing of a Grammatical Sence of Words, againſt their true and eaſie meaning, moſt agreable to the ſubject matter, to the occaſion of ſpeaking of them, and their probable intendment, and to the underſtanding of the Times when they were ſpoken. And that we may be no longer, or more troubled with their Oppoſings to that which is fairly probable, an imagination of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing barely poſſible, and which otherwiſe doth appear notoriouſly falſe. That Objections nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the looſe Stile, eſpecially of partial Hiſtorians, nor from Records of Matters dark and obſcure, which leave us in doubt of their true meaning, and therefore can be no ground for Argument; nor from the various ſence of words, which they make to ſtand for this or that, as it ſerves their turn. At which rate nothing will be certain, becauſe few words have one ſingle determinate Sence, may any longer continue the Subterfuge of a deſperate Cauſe, and matter of endleſs Diſpute. I appeal to the World, whether ſuch like Objections de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an Anſwer, (for to ſome of theſe Topicks, whatever ſhall be produced by our Adverſaries will be reduced:) And whether they are not rude and imperious to the Dignity of the Right in queſtion, to draw it to a Tryal, by ſuch mean and incompetent ways, and unjuſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56755:112"/> as they are otherwiſe in the Management of this Queſtion, to the perſons of thoſe that are concerned in it.</p>
               <p>It is with paſſion to be reſented, that ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Queſtion ſhould be tryed by ſuch means, and incompetent ways of Probation, and by ſuch unnatural meaſures, which can be endured by none but ſuch, who have no meaſures of Right, but an agreableneſs to their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and who are upon the ſearch of Colors and Pretences, to change and alter our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or hurt it in a Vital part, and begin with the Biſhops, to take down our Government.</p>

               <p>I Have farther this juſt Caution to add, for the warding of ſome other undue prejudices in the Conſideration of this queſtion, that our Government did not continue the ſame after, and before the Conqueſt; and that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Conqueſt, hath received ſince many beneficial Alterations. That the Biſhops Right muſt be conſidered in Analogy to thoſe ſeveral Alterations, and in conſequence, they ought not to be conſidered as Barons by Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, when Tenure ceaſed to be the reaſon of Baronage.

               <p>The great change that was made in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage of <hi>England</hi> which we have obſerved, was remedial and healthful. Its Goodneſs doth
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56755:115"/> appear by the thorough Cure it made of our Diſorders: for we have not ſince relaps'd into theſe Evils, from which we recover'd by that Change.

               <p>The Baronage of <hi>England</hi> was an over-grown part, and did by its Exceſs and extravagant Bulk, diſorder the whole Oeconomy of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and became it ſelf leſs uſeful. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

The People were in ſome ſort repreſented by them, as they were a great Body of the Chiefeſt Free-holders; but they had a power to oppreſs them, and they were not obliged by ſo ſtrong a Tye, and plain Duty to a care of the People, becauſe not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by them; and by that Choice, put under a more clear and ſtrict Truſt of taking care of their Rights.

               <p>In the granting Aids for the Support of the Government, and Defence of the Kingdom, a Matter of the greateſt Importance, the Clergy, Nobility, and Commons ſtood divided, and could not, as the Ancient Conſtitution was, by one Act of State, be regularly and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably taxed, according to the Exigency of the Affairs, and their reſpective Abilities; but thoſe three Orders taxed themſelves in ſuch meaſures as they pleaſed, which made the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>Geryon</hi>-like, a Monſter of three Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>

               <p>The Biſhops, Abbots, and other Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons of the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, held their Lands free from all Secular Services; beſides, <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noda Neceſſitas, viz.

This Exemption hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56755:117"/> to them, and made matter of Reproach, though unduely in after Ages. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Exemption, they have aided the Crown with Supplies frequently; yet in ſuch manner as aſſerted and ſaved their ancient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of being exempt, that is, they would not ſuffer themſelves to be involved in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law; but of their own Freedom and Will, gave to the King; which Conceſſions were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding not legal, unleſs confirmed by Parliament, to whom belonged always the power of judging of the Freedom and Ends of giving Aids and Benevolences, and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that required them. But in the laſt Ages, they have, for their Commendation and Honor, waved their pretences of Priviledge and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption; and for the ſake of Common Juſtice, and the Publick Weal, for avoiding, being thought leſs in their Duty to the Publick, than their Order required. And for the better aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, and more equally adjuſting the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Aids, they have ſubmitted to be tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Commons in Parliament we find as late as <hi>Henry</hi> 7. taxing only the Commons, and that by Indenture between them and the King (This Form of Grant, is utterly excluſive of the Lords Power, to charge the <hi>quantum,</hi> times of Payment, or ways of Levying of the Aids granted) wherein they ſubject all Lands to the Levies thereof; but the Lands of the Lords in

               <p>The Commons in Parliament, and thoſe whom they repreſent, being far the greateſt Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they reaſonably challenge it their Right, to propound all Aids, and appointing the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies and Methods of raiſing them, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it muſt be agreed, that the Commons in no congruity can tax the Lords authoritatively, or impoſe upon them) muſt have <hi>civilem intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> that is, the Commons in a Bill of Aids do propound, that they will agree on the behalf of the Commonalty, that they ſhall be taxed as the Bill propounds, if the Lords for their part will agree the ſame.</p>

               <p>NEither was our ancient Government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great faults and inconveniences in the conduct of Religion, the principal care of all Governments on the one ſide, by confounding Adminiſtrations, which ſhould have been kept diſtinct; which was the fault of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, and by utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56755:118"/> and ſevering the Church and State, and not tying the Eccleſiaſticks to a juſt dependency upon the State, which was the Evil of after times; that is to ſay, the Eccleſiaſticks were left to themſelves to convene Councils, and to make Canons, without any dependence upon, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Parliaments. The Conſtitution was ſuch in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, that the Synods or Councils which govern'd in Religious matters were the ſame, with their great Council or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: By theſe means all the Rules and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that were made in the matters of Religion were not Canons, which are of the nature of Councils, but Laws, and obliged thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travened them to temporal puniſhment. The Church was thereby turned into a Dynaſty, and Religion was againſt its nature promoted by force, which can onely truly obtain by perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And whereſoever this is in practice and uſe, the Clergy to the great ſcandal of their Office, will be entituled to all the Severities that ſhall be inflicted upon Diſſenters. Heretofore the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of the Church, and the Authority of the State, were unduly confounded.</p>
               <p>After that we had Legatine Councils, and Provincials convened by the Archbiſhops as they pleaſed, not under the obſervation and controll of the Civil Power; by which many inconveniences were occaſioned, many em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broilments of the people happened, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Prince leſſened, and Civil Rights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56755:118"/> upon; the validity of ſeveral good Laws made in Parliament diſputed, clamoured againſt, and ſentenced as unlawful; for want of a due ſubſervience and dependence of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Conventions on Parliaments. We had <hi>Imperium in Imperio,</hi> or at leaſt a Kingdom divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt it ſelf. This fault in our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was help'd by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Juſtinian;</hi> he in the ſeveral Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Biſhops to Parliament, made it a ſettled Rule, that the clauſe of <hi>Praemunientes</hi> ſhould be inſerted, requiring them therein to warn reſpectively, <hi>Priorem &amp; Capitulum Eccleſiae veſtrae C. ac Archidiaconos, totúmque Clerum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae Dioceſis; quòd iidem Prior</hi> (which if a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral is the ſame as a Dean) <hi>&amp; Archidiaconi, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>túſque Clerus veſtrae Dioceſis, quòd iidem Prior &amp; Archidiaconi in propriis perſonis ſuis, &amp; dictum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulum per unum, idámque Clerus per duos Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratores idoneos, plenam ac ſufficientem poteſtatem ab ipſis Capitulo &amp; Clero habentes, praedictis die &amp; loco perſonaliter interſint, ad conſentiendum his quae tunc ibidem de communi concilio ipſius Regni noſtri, Divinâ favente Clementiâ contigerit, ordinari.</hi> And accordingly the ſeveral Biſhops, in obedience to ſuch like Writs of Summons to Parliament to them directed, ſummoned or warned their Deans or Priors, Archdeacons, and the Clergy by their Proxies; which have ſince made the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the Eccleſiaſtical Council of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and are to meet at every Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56755:119"/> but to debate nothing but what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and to publiſh nothing for Canons without the Royal Aſſent. So that they are to act nothing but under the obſervation of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Convocation or Eccleſiaſtical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil (other allowable Synods we have none) ought not to convene but when a Parliament is ſitting, and continue no longer than the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>We ought to obſerve herein, and applaud the excellent wiſdom of our Government, that in the very conſtituion of it hath provided for the peace of our Church, by ſilencing Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, which can never be determined with any effect; ſuch a wiſe expedient and courſe, as the beſt inſtructed Chriſtian Emperours did take by their Edicts, prohibiting publick Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about ſubtil and nice Queſtions; as <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Martianus, Leo &amp; Anthemius, Andronicus, Heraclius,</hi> to mention no more. None but mad men and extravagantly preſumptuous, or utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of Church Hiſtory, will ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after go about by Acts of Councils to end Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, but rather to ſhame the Dogmatizers out of their contentious zeal, by ſhewing how little the ends and deſigns of Chriſtianity are concerned one way or other in ſuch Queſtions, in which thoſe that are moſt learned know leaſt; and a little learned ignorance would diſcharge moſt of them from any longer troubling the world.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:56755:119"/>
               <p>And farther, we muſt obſerve, to the Honor of our Nation, that it is ſo religiouſly wiſe, as to commit the Care of conducting Devotions, ordering the Decency of Publick Worſhip, and cenſuring the Manners of Clerks to the Biſhops, and the Principal Clergy; whereto their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Wiſdom, Devotion and Moderation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak them the fitteſt Perſons.</p>
               <p>No leſs remarkable is the Wiſdom of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that it doth not make that, which is properly the matter of Canons, the Subject of their Legiſlation; and thereby ſubject us to Temporal Puniſhments, where the Admonitions of the Church and her Cenſures, are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned Remedies to the diſobedient and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Laws oblige us to puniſhments, govern us by Fear and Awe, oblige with Reaſon or without Reaſon, becauſe they are Laws. They admit of no Eccleſiaſtical Relaxation or Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and bind when the reaſon ceaſeth. In whatſoever thing relative to Religon a Law is made, the matter is taken out of the Hands of the Church-men, and no longer under their Government, whoſe Government is a Miniſtry, not Empire and Dominion. They can inſtitute nothing but what they may reaſonably perſuade, <hi>Nihil tam voluntarium quam Religio.</hi> Lact. We can have no more Religion or Truth than we can perſuade. Religion and Truth are to be promoted by moving the Will. The Church rules by perſuaſion, and her Canons oblige on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56755:120"/> for their Reaſon, Religion for the ſake of our own Edification, and the Edification of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Peace of the Church, and Reverence of our Paſtors and Teachers. Canons in their own Nature are Temporary, for the preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and convenience, variable and mutable, as the Edification of the Church ſhall require, and the prudence of the Guides of the Church ſhall determine; and therefore what is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Matter of Canons, ought not to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Laws which are rigid and inflexible, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, punitive and ungovernable. And this magnifies the prudence and Chriſtian Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelates.</p>

               <p>LAſtly, I obſerve what a dangerous Opinion our Judges ſometimes had in reference to the Baronage of <hi>England, viz.</hi> that it was in the Power of the King, or in any Nobleman, once ſummoned by Writ to Parliament, as a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, at the pleaſure of the King, to relinquiſh his place, and determine the Nobility of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Which Opinion not being corrected, would have made that State ambulatory and moveable, upon which the whole Frame of the Government depends. The Baronage of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is the Stabiliment of our Government, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56755:120"/> may be ſoon made too weak to ſupport the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater parts of the Building, that reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and are ſupported by it. It is this that moderates between the two contending Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Prerogative and Liberty; and prevents thoſe violent Concuſſions, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unavoidably happen.</p>

               <p>Of what Importance therefore is it, that we ſhould be a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, as much as Humane Wiſdom can provide, and frail Materials will admit? That our Baronage ſhould not hold their places precariouſly at the King's Pleaſure, and be depoſed at his Will. And yet our Judges, after that Honor was fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Families of thoſe whom the King ſhould appoint by Writ, to hold that Honor and Place in the Commonwealth, remembring, that Baronage was at firſt a Service impoſed <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one tenurae,</hi> by <hi>Will.</hi> the Conqueror: Our Judges, I ſay, more able to judge of Private Rights, than in Queſtions of State and Government, being under a prejudice, from the Conſideration of the Original of our Baronies, did allow the Plea of <hi>Thomas de Furnival,</hi> who had been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſeveral Parliaments by Writ, that he was no Baron, for that he held not his Land <hi>per Baroniam, vel partem Baroniae,</hi> and therefore adjudged him no Baron. <hi>Communia de Term.

And the whole Houſe doth conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to act, until the Lord that complains of an Omiſſion, hath a Writ of Summons ſent him.</p>
               <p>What Apprehenſions was had of this Honor, by <hi>Thomas de Furnival,</hi> and others in his time, I know not. But it might have been then, and ſince it is well underſtood, that that place which they ſuſtain in the Government, is of the higheſt Truſt; and the Benefits which redound therefrom to the Commonweal, the greateſt: For they make the Government as well gentle and good, as firm and ſtable.</p>
               <p>Theſe Noble Lords <hi>Marchers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> are placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two great Contending Powers, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the due Boundaries and reſpective Limits, and oblige them to Right and Reaſon, by their Courage and Wiſdom. And for their Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and Reward, deſerve the higheſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; and that they ſhould be as they are, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal in their Families. And accordingly it was reſolved lately in the Caſe of the Honor of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:56755:121"/> in the Lords Houſe, that no Fine or Surrender of the Honor of a Baron can extinguiſh it: But that notwithſtanding it ſhall continue to his Heirs and Deſcendents: And that upon the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt important Reaſon; for that the Conſtitution of the Government, ought not (as in its own Nature it cannot) to depend upon the Will of the Prince, nor of Single Perſons, that bore a part in the Government for their time, nor be prejudiced in Succeſſion by their Lacheſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame Priviledge doth belong to the Spiritual Baronage, the ſucceſſive Nobility of this Realm; and a Writ of Summons to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be no more refuſed any of them, or any of their Succeſſors, than it can to any of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Baronage. I cannot but upon a review of our Government, applaud our happineſs that we enjoy, and were born to ſo excellent a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without our Sweat and Contrivance; which was arrived to by ſeveral ſlow Steps, and beaten out by the long experience of former Ages.</p>
               <p>But it is a portentous thing, and of ill, very ill Omen, that a Government ſo Venerable and Auguſt, ſo Wiſe, Beneficial and deſireable, ſhould be aſſaulted with peeviſh Dotages, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Petulances, and childiſh Cavillations: And that ſome Brain-ſick, fooliſh Antiquaries, Rakers in the Rubbiſh of Time, ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that they can barter away our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>FOr I am not now inſenſible of the great Prejudices that lie againſt the Right of the queſtion, from thoſe Calumnies that are thrown upon the Order: And that no reaſon, not the cleareſt Demonſtration will be admitted to any Degree of ſatisfaction, until this be removed. Men's underſtandings are mingled with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and Paſſions. It is a hard matter not to ſee the perſon in the Cauſe; and if the perſon is diſ-eſteemed, his Right cannot be equally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd: Nay which is more, if our Adverſaries can perſuade the World, that the Biſhops will abuſe this their Right, nothing will be able to keep off this Concluſion, that they have none.</p>
               <p>We moſt duly therefore here complain of the dishoneſt Artifice uſed by the Gentlemen, that we have undertaken in this Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſeek all occaſions of leſſening the eſteem of the Biſhops; and of them, they ſpeak what they will. He that can believe what he will,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56755:122"/> is an Infidel, and he that does what he will, is a man of no Conſcience; and he that can ſpeak what he will, wants Truth and Candor: But of a culpable ſort of Wilfulneſs we finde theſe two Authors very blameable.</p>
               <p>We muſt complain of theſe fierce diſputants, that they ſtrive unlawfully, they contend with paſſion, and a keen Animoſity; they ſtrike as well as argue, they lay about them right or wrong, to aſſault and wound the Perſons, whoſe Right they oppoſe. A wound and Diſhonour do they give to their own hurt.</p>
               <q>Animoſque in Vulnere ponunt.</q>
               <p>The firſt and greateſt Injuſtice they do to the Cauſe againſt all Right and Reaſon, of which ſure they muſt be ſelf-condemned, is an odious Remembrance of any thing culpable in the whole Succeſſion of Biſhops, in the times of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degeneracy of the Chriſtian Religion, and of the heighth of Papal Uſurpation and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; which was more heavy in thoſe times, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rights of the Biſhops, than upon thoſe of the Crown.</p>
               <p>When Princes thorough their own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or to ſerve their Intereſt, or to ſupport their defective Titles to their Crowns, or for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining diſpenſations from his Holineſs, for an unwarrantable Marriage, or for other Ends and Reaſons could not, or would not defend the Biſhops and their Rights.</p>
               <p>The very order of Biſhops in thoſe times was attempted upon, to be annulled by that Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56755:123"/> Uſurper. It was diſputed and boldly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> that the Biſhops were only <hi>jure Pontificio,</hi> and had no Authority in the Church, but ſuch as his Holineſs would vouchſafe them. It was endeavoured to make them but his Subſtitutes: He pretended Powers to create and tranſlate them, diminiſh or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their Dioceſes; gave them more or leſs Authority, did ſuſpend them alſo, and deprive them; and pretended, that they had only a vicarious and precarious Authority from him; and in ſuch Meaſures as he ſhould think fit to limit and appoint. Were not Proviſions and Reſervations firſt made by the Pope, upon Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices belonging to Churchmen? The Statute of the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. gave their Preſentations to the King, when the Pope uſurped upon them, as a Fortification againſt his Uſurpation and Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Did he not urge his Canon upon them, that they ſhould not <hi>agitare judicium ſanguinis,</hi> ſo much talk'd of in this Queſtion, that he might ſtrip them out of their Secular Greatneſs, that he might the better go over them, and tread upon them and their Eccleſiaſtical Rights?</p>
               <p>Is there no Conſideration to be had by thoſe Gentlemen, in this Caſe of the <hi>Error temporis,</hi> or <hi>Vitia Temporum;</hi> They will ſnatch at this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duely when it ſeems for their turn; but can they think that any Biſhop, under a Proteſtant Sovereign, will ever return under the old Yoak?</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:56755:123"/>
               <p>And yet the buſineſs of Proviſions, Reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Diſpenſations, and of Pluralties, muſt be laid at the Biſhops Door (yea, though Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Pluralties, is now eſtabliſhed by Statute Law,) with all the Uſurpations exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Pope, the Firſt-born of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Pride, to which they willingly-unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly were forced to ſubmit.</p>
               <p>But how unrighteous a thing is it to load the Order it ſelf with all the Miſcarriages of a long Courſe of Succeſſion? as if the Faults of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in all Ages, did ſtick to their reſpective Chairs, and had paſſed into the Office it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But it is no wonder, that they remember the Faults of thoſe Biſhops unduely, to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement and Diſhonor of the Order and Succeſſion: When the <hi>Folio</hi> turns matter of Commendation into Reproach, and calls their contending for due Adminiſtration of Juſtice and Laws, Clamors for the Breach of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>

               <p>The Biſhops challenge nothing to belong to them of Divine Right, but the Exerciſe of their Miniſtry in the Cure of Souls.</p>
               <p>They do not aſſume the Office of themſelves, but are appointed thereto by the Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and therefore the Bench of Biſhops are not anſwerable for every one of their Order. They rightfully acknowledge the Right of Inveſtiture, and Collation of Biſhopricks to be in the King, ſubject to Royal Exemptions and Priviledges from their ordinary Right. From which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> is too forward to conclude his Doctrine of <hi>Eraſtianiſm,</hi> for that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Function may be reſtrained, as well in reference to Perſons or Territories, by the Civil Authority.</p>
               <p>Their Convocations are convened by the King's Writ; they debate nothing without his
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56755:124"/> Leave. Their Reſults become Canons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Sanction by the Royal Authority, and do not pretend to infringe any Temporal or Civil Right or Law. And beſides, their Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are always to be held, ſittting Parliaments, and no longer, not at any other times: And whatever they debate or reſolve, is under the Obſervation of Parliament. <hi>Nequid detrimenti capiat Reſpublica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhops make no Laws about Religion apart by themſelves, neither have they any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative againſt any that are propounded, and therefore are not anſwerable for any that are made or not made. They have not the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hereſie, but the Law hath declared it ſince the Reformation. And the Writ <hi>De Heretico comburendo</hi> is ſince abrogated by the Chriſtian Temper of a Parliament, principally conſiſting of ſuch Members, that were conformable to the Inſtitutions of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that is, the legal Eſtabliſhments of this our Chriſtian Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> is no more her own preſent Eſtabliſhments, than the preſent thoughts of any man is the man himſelf; as the thoughts of a man are more refined and unreprovable as the man grows wiſer, ſo do the Laws and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, the Orders and Rules of a Church or Chriſtian Republick, alter, amend, and improve, as the Wiſdom and Virtue, Religion and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government, and the principal parts
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56755:125"/> thereof in Church or State increaſeth or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.</p>
               <p>Our Biſhops have had, and that with the greateſt reaſon, greater apprehenſions of Schiſm and Separation, than of Errors in Opinion which occaſioned it, as of worſe importance to the Chriſtian Faith than the Errors themſelves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that a man cannot help being miſtaken in many things; but it is in every mans power to be modeſt and peaceable, and wiſe to ſobriety, and <hi>hold the unity of the faith in the bond of peace and charity,</hi> and not to revile and deprave that which hath the publick approbation, though he cannot thereto fully aſſent. It is great iniquity and unrighteouſneſs, to pretend to Liberty of Conſcience as their right, and in the mean time not to tolerate the publick appointments, and what is authoritatively allowed and approved.</p>
               <p>If Controvertible Opinions are allowed a Warrant for making a Sect and ſeparate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and Churches are denominated and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by them; and conſequently ſuch Opinions are advanced unduly unto the ſame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of belief as Articles of Faith: what will become of the Chriſtian Verity? where will it be recognized and purely profeſſed? how diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed? how underſtood? how aſcertained amidſt the number of Opinions contended for, by the ſeveral dogmatizing Sectaries, with more zele than the undoubted and uncontrovertible Articles of Faith?</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:56755:125"/>
               <p>Nay, I will adventure to ſay further on their behalf, that Schiſmatical Separations would not offend them, (ſo little do they affect to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial) but for that if this Diſeaſe ſhould grow Epidemical, there would be no ſuch thing as a Chriſtian Church, and the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would periſh from the earth without a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
               <p>It is onely deſigned by our Church, that thoſe whoſe Subſcriptions are required, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by onely ſignifie their allowance of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Articles, as fit to be uſed and allowable. What Plea then can our Separatiſts have for a Toleration for themſelves; who by their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſeem unwilling to tolerate the publick Eſtabliſhment, either from our Governours Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Eccleſiaſtical, or from one another in their divided ways.</p>
               <p>To reform or change to theſe mens pleaſures is impoſſible, for that they cannot (they poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively differing from each other) be all pleaſed in any one poſſible Eſtabliſhment. Beſides that, untill we ceaſe to be Schiſmaticks, and to be of ſeparate and divided Communions upon the ſcore of any diſlike, or but probable exception to what is publickly received or allowed, the altering any thing for our ſatisfaction, will be but applying the Cure to the Symptoms, a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off one head of the <hi>Hydra.</hi> By this way to effect an union is as impoſſible as it would be to empty the Ocean, without ſtopping the cur-of the Rivers.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:56755:126"/>
               <p>The Biſhops are (as all men, by how much they are better learned, are) of the greateſt Moderation in Opinions, and can tell how due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rate and value them (according to the Prejudice or Advantage they do to the Ends of our Religon) thoſe ſeveral Opinions, that have been contended with furious and rending Zeal, in the ſeveral Ages of the Church, to the Scandal of that peaceable Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>They can have a better Opinion of that man who hath unhappily entertained the leſs proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſide of the Queſtions controverted, if he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines with Modeſty, than they have of him, that holds the moſt probable part thereof, with a Sectary-Zeal, Seperation from, Contempt and Diſdain of thoſe of a different perſuaſion. Their Moderation is known unto all men, of it their Oppoſers have had very ſenſible Experience, the ſeveral Diſſenters cannot diſown it; but muſt confeſs, that they have had ſeverally kinder U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the Epiſcopal Men, than their ſeveral Parties have from one another.</p>
               <p>By their Learning, Wiſdom and Moderation, which is moſt eminently known and obſerved in many of them, and hath recommended them to the higheſt Eſteem they muſt be allowed, their Enemies being Judges, to be the fitteſt Arbiters of the Controverſies, and the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and probable Procurers of the Peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:56755:126"/>
               <p>All the Diſſenting Parties have reaſon to look upon them, as their Common Sanctuary, and Defence againſt the Outrages of each other.</p>
               <p>But in this they muſt be pardoned, if they, being under a Law or Rule of their Superiors (made, as they think, in a matter lawful) act accordingly, and do not diſobey for their ſake who think otherwiſe, though in the mean time they pity their Scruples.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Terms of the Nonconforming Miniſters have been made hard upon them; But that hath been from Reaſons of State, which the late unhappy Wars occaſioned, and they were ejected out of their Livings by Statute-Law. And on the other ſide it is true, that many men, not to fit for that Holy Function have enjoyed Church Benefices; but neither this can the Biſhops help: For they cannot reject a Clerk preſented to a Benefice, or eject him, but as the Law will, (ſo ſacred is the Right of Patronage, and ſo fixed by the Law, are Miniſters in their Livings) which is not Nice in the manners of Clerks, and the Biſhops cannot be ſeverer than the Laws.</p>
               <p>So that if ſome men, not of the moſt unblama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble converſations, have kept their Livings, and ſome of very unexceptionable Lives have been ejected: The unhappy Nonconformiſts are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected where to make their Complaint.</p>
               <p>But as there is little Cauſe of complaint, on this part of the Epiſcopal Authority and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56755:127"/> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Their Superintendency over the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of their Dioceſes: So we ſhall obſerve how they have behaved themſelves in the Exerciſe of the Power of the Keys: For what is done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by their Chancellors and Officials, to whom Cuſtom hath given ſome Powers and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which cannot be check'd and controul'd by the Biſhops themſelves, they are not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, neither are they anſwerable for the Lay-Zeal that hath made the Condition of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants ſo very afflictive. For whatever ſome men pleaſe to think, the Laity have out-done the Eccleſiaſticks in the Exceſſes of intemperate Zeal, as they are moſt apt, and prone by their Ignorance to Superſtition. No man can paſs under the Admonitions of the Church, and be ſuſpended from the Holy Myſteries, until he hath made Satisfaction for his diſorderly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Spiritual Pride, in breaking Order; but he is preſently given up by the Laity to Satan. I mean, he ſuffers beyond the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Church in her Diſcipline. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities enacted by the Law of the State, which if reverſed by that Authority that eſtabliſhed them, and a civil Proceſs were enacted for the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, in Cauſes of a Temporal Nature, which are appointed by Law to their cognizance. I perſuade my ſelf, we ſhould hear of no more Complaints againſt them in the Exerciſe of the Power of the Keys.</p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:56755:127"/>
               <p>For we obſerve, that they exerciſe the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keys with deference to the Secular Magiſtrates. They never preſume to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Prince, leaſt they ſhould thereby leſſen his Authority, and ſhock the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For that all Government is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Honor and Reverence of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, according to that Saying of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Diſſolution of Government doth eaſily follow the Contempt of the Governor. As Kings are not ſubject to Penal Laws, nor to be coerced by Penalties: So true it is alſo, what <hi>Balſamo</hi> hath noted, <hi>ad</hi> 12 <hi>Canonem Synod. Ancyranae, Imperatoriâ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione penitentiam tolli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither do they preſume in Reverence to the King, to excommunicate his Counſellors, and Miniſters of State and Juſtice: For ſo it was declared amongſt other of the <hi>Avitae conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudines</hi> of this Realm, by the Aſſize of <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Nullus qui de Rege teneat in Capite, nec ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis dominicorum miniſtrorum ejus excommunice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, niſi prius Dominus Rex conveniatur.</hi> In which our Biſhops are agreable to the Ancients. <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debert Cenoman,</hi> after Biſhop of <hi>Tours,</hi> who lived about the eleventh Century, ſays he, <hi>Apud Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reniſſimum Regem opus eſt exhortatione potius quam increpatione, Concilio quam praeceptis, doctrinâ quam virgâ. Ivo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> in his Apology for communicating.— <hi>Gervaſius</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Quos culpatorum Regia Poteſtas, aut in gratiam be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitatis
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56755:128"/> receperit, aut menſae ſuae participes fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, eos etiam Sacerdotum &amp; populorum conventus ſuſcipere in Eccleſiaſtica Communione debebit; ut quod principalis pietas recipit, nec à Sacerdotibus Dei alienum habeatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus while the Biſhops are not guilty of mean and unfaithful flatteries, they do not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the pride of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the irreverence and ſawcineſs of a Presbyterian Conſiſtory againſt their Princes and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</p>
               <p>Neither do they call up any criminal cauſe originally to their examination, but pronounce the ſentence of Excommunication on ſuch one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as firſt are civilly convict of a crime; ſave that matters of Incontinency are by the Common Law ſubmitted to their Cenſure, for that by the venerable gravity of the Judge, and by the more private examination of ſuch offences, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of the Nation is beſt preſerved, which is a ſurer defenſative againſt the rifeneſs of ſuch crimes, perhaps than the ſharpeſt puniſhments.</p>
               <p>If they do excommunicate any man without a juſt cauſe, or do not abſolve the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate when he hath made his ſatisfactions, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is compellable by the Authority of the Kings Courts to aſſoil the man, under the pain of having his Temporalities ſeized into the Kings hands, though he is not reſtored without the Epiſcopal Abſolution. For it is fit they ſhould finally judge in their own proper Province; and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56755:128"/> they muſt not, they cannot relax the Laws of Chriſt, nor adminiſter the power of the Keys of binding and loſing, by any other meaſures, for any power on earth. But againſt this power of the Kings Courts they do not diſpute or declare, but have recognized it by their ſubmiſſion, and they can ſubmit to the penalties, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of this civil conſtitution. Nay, in the general order they approve it, though in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe perhaps they do not, becauſe they cannot obey.</p>
               <p>Our Biſhops do not encroach any Temporal Authority <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia;</hi> that ſtale pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to his exorbitant power, and by which the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyters would have acquired the like over Kings and Governours. Their Authority always adminiſters to and aſſiſts but never thwarts or contradicts the Temporal. They have accommodated their power of the Keys, to the vindication of our eſtabliſhed Government againſt the attempts of Arbitrary Power, to which their Allegeance to the King, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the publick Peace, did oblige them. For ſuch Attempts are moſtly the ruin of thoſe that make them, always bring the Government it ſelf into the greateſt danger, and ſometimes prove the ruin both of the Government and the Nation.</p>
               <p>This was required of them as an indiſpenſible duty, they being a principal part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56755:129"/> and the preſent Biſhops Succeſſours to all their Rights, have no reaſon to decline their example, if they have the like cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops anciently were ſturdy oppoſers of King <hi>John,</hi> when he deſigned to put this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into vaſſallage to the Pope, and thereupon he writes to the Pope thus as followeth: <hi>In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectu paternitatis veſtrae humiliamus ad gratias mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplices, prout meliùs ſcimus &amp; poſſumus, exhiben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, pro cura &amp; ſollicitudine, quam ad deſenſionem noſtram &amp; Regni noſtri Angliae, paterna veſtra be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolentia indeſinenter apponit, licèt duritia Praela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum Angliae &amp; inobedientia impediant veſtrae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſionis effectum.

               <p>By which the exemplary zele of the Biſhops in thoſe times againſt Oppreſſion, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the common Rights, and the attempts of abſolute and unlimited power appears; for that they prevented the Temporal Baronage, and outdid the Parliament it ſelf in defending and guarding the Government of Laws. By the way we cannot but take notice of Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> his miſtake in his book <hi>De Synedriis,</hi> which he fell into by inſerving to his beloved <hi>Eraſtian Hypotheſis, viz.</hi> That that Excommunication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned in 37 <hi>H.</hi> 3. was enacted by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, whereas it was onely confirmed, but pronounced by the Biſhops, though with the ſeeming good liking of that King: ſo that the Power of the Keys was not uſurp'd, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thereof approved by Parliament; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what hath been uſual, as <hi>Grotius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>

               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:56755:130"/>
               <p>They pretend to a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> only, for that which merely concerns their Spiritual Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and I cannot for my part ſuſpect them of holding any Opinion of a <hi>Jus divinum</hi> in Civil Offices, which are of a Humane Original, becauſe I can imagine no reaſon for ſuch an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, though I know it is by ſome imputed to them.</p>
               <p>By a <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Becket,</hi> a <hi>Sibthorp,</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring,</hi> and a few leſs-conſidering Clergy-men in an Age, we are not to conclude the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body of our Learned Clergy. They aſſuredly know, as all men in their Wits do believe, that the Government is <hi>de jure,</hi> ſuch as it is, and can be no other, nor rightfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any Alteration. That God never made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Commonwealth but one, by his directive Will, and that only for one Nation (for in theſe things, he hath left men ordinarily in the Hands of their own Councils, and to their own Prudence) in which he had no regard to the abſolute rightful Sovereignty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s right Heir, the wildeſt certainly of all the Paradox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that this giddy phantaſtick Age hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Knight ſhould have kept his Dream to himſelf, until he had found him out, and then have brought him and his Book called <hi>Patriarcha,</hi> together to the King: Then I doubt not, but his Majeſty would have provided him his due Reward. But his Book, and the Publiſhers thereof, deſerve his Majeſty's
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56755:131"/> utmoſt Diſpleaſute: For we are in fear that the Government is about to be changed, when Books are licenſed to prove any thing Lawful in that kind. And beſides, it makes a Charge upon our Divines, that they have a good liking to the Deſign; for that they who beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by their Profeſſion the <hi>jura divina,</hi> have not anſwered it. But to ſpeak the Truth, the Book is not to be anſwered: For it is but a fine Eſſay, how near Non-ſence may be made to look like Sence; and it is truly worth no man's Undertaking.</p>
               <p>But whatſoever ſiniſter thoughts ſome ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Men to the Biſhops may conceive of them, we expect, and with reaſon too, that they will, with equal Courage to that recorded of their Predeceſſors, ſtand up for the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government, in its true and rightful Conſtitution. And the rather, for that the true Religion, their Principal Care, and their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Rights and Dignities, will inevitably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the Change: Nay, perhaps in conſequence of the very Attempt of a Change, except they ſtrenuouſly for their parts oppoſe it. However their Order, will certainly, by their Silence and Indifferency, be rendred deſpicable. They will loſe all opinion with the People, of their Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, perform their Functions with no advantage, and loſe that ſhare in the Honors and Affections of the People, that will eſtabliſh them, &amp; beſpeak them uſeful and neceſſary to the Church and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56755:131"/> ſtate in their ſeveral Capacities, in all after times. That they anſwer their Truſt, and perform that Duty which they owe to the Publick in their ſeveral Offices, is that we may juſtly expect: And this they will certainly do, though they ſhould be cenſured, as they were in K. <hi>John</hi>'s days; or in the Language of the <hi>Folio</hi> Author, charged to be clamorous and over-buſie Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in Matters of State and Government. But to return;</p>
               <p>Is it not a courſe Artifice, in the <hi>Octavo, pag.</hi> 96. that he will ſo willfully miſtake the Queſtion'd of the Biſhops, being one of the three States, and repreſenting the Matter; as if the Biſhops ſhould have a Negative by themſelves, to ſtop the paſſing of any Bill, if they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be a diſtinct State.</p>

               <p>WHen it is not diſputed, or brought into Queſtion, whether they are divided in their Voting from the Temporal Barons, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they never were; nor was it ever diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Though an obſtinate Opinion was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Time of <hi>E.</hi> 2. in the Caſe of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> until the Time of <hi>E.</hi> 5. in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that the Biſhops Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was neceſſary in Judgments, even in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56755:132"/> Cauſes, which muſt be allowed a clear Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for their Right of Judgment in ſuch Cauſes. For the Spiritual and Temporal Lords, though two States, make but one Houſe upon the Reaſons afore-mentioned, according to the general Underſtanding and Uſage of former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But upon this Suppoſition, he tells us of ſeveral Bills that gave furtherance to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to which the Biſhops did not aſſent, and would never have paſſed, if they had had a Negative upon them. But by his Favor, theſe Inſtances of his, are great Arguments of thoſe Biſhops their Sincerity: For they muſt needs be under great and violent Prejudices: Beſides, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very great man (as the Author of the Letter well knows) is apt to value himſelf, and cares not to be accounted a light man; and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in place, the more unwilling to be found in a Miſtake; and they are not content, if Old Men,</p>
               <q>Quae juvenes dedicere ſenes perdenda fateri.</q>
               <p>There is good Hopes therefore, that our Rightfully Reformed Biſhops will be the laſt that will give up the Cauſe of Reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and will not be out-done by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Biſhops in Conſtancy, when they have a better Cauſe.</p>
               <p>I muſt likewiſe take notice to do the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Lords Juſtice, of the Behavior of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56755:132"/> in <hi>Folio</hi> towards the Biſhops. He takes notice, and that dutifully, of the Satyrical (ſo he calls it) Language of the Pamphleteers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Court, and the greateſt Scurrilities with which the Houſe of Commons are aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but has not heard, ſure, of any againſt the Biſhops, and the whole Eccleſiaſtical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: For he makes not the leaſt mention of any ſuch: But becauſe they ſhall not eſcape (beſides that, in his Book he declaims <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, againſt the Order, and ſeems ſo fond of this Office, that he forbids all other the uſe of the Cart) he tells the Story of <hi>Hepheſtion</hi> and <hi>Craterus,</hi> the one of which loved <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the other the King. By this Apologue, I doubt not, but he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Slander; and to ſignifie thereby ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſtly, a lewd Reproach, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Biſhops are not true Servants of the King and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of themſelves; than which a falſer thing, I hope, cannot be ſaid, nor a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious thing imagined, if not true: For he may know, that they are better men in their true Character, than his Loyal Patriots, that are true to the King, and Houſe of Commons: For they have, I doubt not, I am ſure they ought to have a care of the whole Government in the Integrity of its Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops well know how much the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are concerned in the Greatneſs of the Houſe of Lords, which eſtabliſheth the Throne, and makes, and ſupports the King Great; and by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56755:133"/> their Power and Intereſt, make his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment equal; to which they contribute no ſmall Share; for to them is entruſted, by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our Lord Chriſt, the Conduct of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that mighty and momentous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, hath commended them, and advanced them to the State of Peerage; and will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue them in great Authority with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as long as the Nation continues in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree Religious. The Temporal Baronage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want them in the Support of that mighty Province that belongs to that Houſe. In them the People will find their Intereſt, as long as they can value Wiſdom and Religion, that is, as long as they are Chriſtian Men; and by them the Kingly Office will find it ſelf ſerved, as long as true Religion and Wiſdom can mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the Support of Government, and wiſe and good men under the greateſt Truſt, and in the higheſt Dignity in the Government, can be fit Councellors and Miniſters of State.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Octavo</hi> hath alſo a hint to this purpoſe: for <hi>pag.</hi> 30. where he brings in the Caſe of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Arundel,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> when all the Biſhops made Sir <hi>Thomas Piercy</hi> their Procurator, he ſays, That uniting in one man, argued a great Unanimity in the Voting of the Prelates; which ſeems, ſaith he, hath ever been. The meaning of this is a ſly Diſparagement of the Biſhops in their Voting, <hi>viz.</hi> that have one Common Tie and Dependency upon the Crown,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56755:133"/> that determines them to their Intereſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the Unanimity of Voting.</p>
               <p>But are the Biſhops more depending, becauſe they once for all received their Temporalities from the King, than the Temporal Lords, who are commoly Officers of State, and otherwiſe depend upon their Prince's Favor? Is not the Biſhops Advancement rather a Reward to their Eminent Services, performed in the matter of Religon, of the greateſt Importance certainly to the State, and a Recognition of the excellent Character of thoſe men that are preferred to that Office, than a Bribe upon their Actings, after they have that Favor irrevocable.</p>
               <p>Do not we know that the Services of Church-men are rewardable upon the Churches Stock, and that the King need not impair the Royal Treaſure, to pay Thanks to Epiſcopal Men, whoſe Worth doth beſpeak the Royal Favor to that Preferment and Advancement? Are not the Temporalities of the Church, the King's on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give, but not to retain? What evil Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice or Obligation can this be to any man, to ſerve the King unfaithfully, who hath choſen him perhaps, though there were others but as equally fit for that Office: For we ought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no other diſpoſition of thoſe Dignities, than what is juſt and fit in our general Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, however things are adminiſtred in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Caſes.</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:56755:134"/>
               <p>Is not this an Office, together with its main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, of the Proviſion of the Law, and not of the King.</p>
               <p>But to remove that Scandal of their Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in voting, which ſome have reproached with a ſcoffing Term of a dead Weight, it may be conſidered, that Men of the beſt Judgments and Honeſty moſtly agree: That Variety of Judgments proceeds oftner from Paſſion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, than from Difficulty of the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. It moſtly grows, either from want of Integrity, or want of Judgment. Agreement in Votes, is an Argument therefore of true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and unbiaſſed Integrity: As it is alſo far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of a good Correſpondence amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of previous Debates, and more mature Deliberation. Beſides, that it is no unuſual thing in difficult and lubricous Affairs, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to compromiſe the matters to a few, or to the Majority of their own Numbers, and abide the Reſult of the <hi>major</hi> part.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this matter of Exception to the Integrity of my Lords the Biſhops, in the great Affair now in Agitation, is <hi>argumentum ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi> and gives Prejudice to the true Right and Merits of the Cauſe; and is the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent and hopeful Argument, if not the only one that our Adverſaries can rely upon: For whatever the <hi>Cauſa juſtifica,</hi> or Pretence be, for the eſpouſing of any Opinion, or part of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Controverſie, if the <hi>Cauſa ſuaſoria,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56755:134"/> and true moving cauſe thereto be ſtrong and perſuaſive, the ſlighteſt Reaſons will be a pretence for Confidence, and the ſmalleſt Color of Right, ſhall prevail finally, and in the laſt Iſſue, eſpecially where the Parties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſt judge; or by their Power, can make their Will, and determinate Reſolves, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the biggeſt purpoſes. I will therefore farther add, that we well know what a high Eſteem their true Character doth deſerve.</p>
               <p>That they are intended the Light of the World, the Salt of the Earth: If the Salt hath loſt its Savor, wherewith ſhall it be Seaſoned? And if our Light be darkened, how great is our Darkneſs. The Biſhops know, that the World will not be kept in Order, by meer Deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Truſt, but by Execution of their Truſts, not by abſtract of Characters, unleſs they are put on, and effectively worn. The World will not be put off, that there is no Proviſion made in the Government for reaſonable Expectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of all that can make a People happy, if we are diſappointed in our juſt Expectations. They know for what high Ends they are advanced to their Secular Dignities, what was it that hath thus advanced them. Was it not the reaſonable Expectation that Chriſtian Princes and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors conceived of their excellent Virtues, that they would out-doe all mankind in firm Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, a vaſt and extenſive Charity, unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fortitude, inflexible Juſtice, unmoveable
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56755:135"/> Faith and Loyalty, and unbyaſſed Sincerity? What Temptations can their Lordſhips have, that they ſhould not, or we Reaſons to believe, that they will not put forth all thoſe Chriſtian Vertues in Heroical Degrees, which the World will not give them leave to exert only in common meaſures? They will find it neceſſary ſure to be now Confeſſors for the Support and Happineſs of a poor diſtracted Nation, a vaſt and great People. They will, no doubt, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Greateſt Potentate to Juſtice (if there be any ſuch) who hath unhing'd the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſap'd the very Foundations of our Conſtitution, and will never conſent to the Pardon of ſuch Sins, that are not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in this World, nor in the World to come.</p>
               <p>Can they ſuffer the true Chriſtian Religion, of which they are the chief Miniſters and Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to periſh by their timidity and cowardiſe? Can they ſuffer a great People committed to their charge, to be deſtroyed into an Anarchy, and deſert that Prince whoſe Beneficiaries they are, and not interpoſe for the ſaving of him and his Government, by faithful and wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel?</p>
               <p>To ſuppoſe ſuch things as are morally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is unreaſonable, and to fear where no fear is. For they, if they were wholly ſecular, and were guided by nothing but a ſecular Intereſt, can conſider that the world is impatient of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56755:135"/> That they hate nothing more than deceits and abuſe of truſts, and that he that falls ſhort, and goes leſs than a juſt expectation, falls into the loweſt and vileſt contempt and deepeſt ſcorn.</p>
               <p>But this is not a time ſure to leſſen the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, to take from the Biſhops any juſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or honour, when that the contempt in this later age thrown upon them, and the whole Order Eccleſiaſtical, and the miſchiefs that have naturally enſued thereupon, have brought our Nation, Religion, and Government, to a moſt miſerable ſtate, a moſt deſperate plunge, out of which I pray God we may be able to emerge.</p>
               <p>The Contempt of the Biſhops and Clergy made the People deſpiſe the publick Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, chuſe Teachers not much wiſer than themſelves: And they have thereupon multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vain Opinions and Diviſions, and true Chriſtianity, is ſcarce had in any Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Atheiſm and Profaneneſs upon this Stock, is come to an enormous Growth, which thrives the faſter, by the vain Opinions and Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the miſtaken Religioniſts, by which the Atheiſts take the Meaſures of true Chriſtianity; and in Conſequence of this, Popery is arrived to a vaſt Increaſe in Power and Intereſt, and threatens us, and the little Remains of true Reformed Chriſtianity with an utter Overthrow. The true Chriſtian Religion is not generally underſtood, and hath loſt almoſt all Credit and Belief in a Chriſtian Nation.</p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:56755:136"/>
               <p>So that it ſeems to me, upon the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our preſent State, almoſt neceſſary, that the Truth of the Chriſtian Faith ſhould be again demonſtrated in Flames to this Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, flagitious and degenerate Age, that the Stains of the Chriſtian Religion muſt be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off by the Blood of the Sincere Profeſſors. That the true Faith ſhould be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as it will be by dying Thoughts, and vain Opinions, be deſtroyed, and burn up like Hay and Stubble, in the Fire of Perſecution: For then we ſhall underſtand what it is that is worth dying for, and that which is not worth dying for, is not worth diſputing and dividing for in our Chriſtian Communions, with breach of Charity. Then our Guides, the Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Biſhops, and other Faithful Paſtors of the Church, may ſhew their Sincerity, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of what Value they are of in the Conduct of Souls, by their wiſe Apologies and Noble Confeſſions and Martyrdoms for the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, and recover a due place in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Reverence and Eſteem for their Succeſſors. And if God, in all his wiſe Providence and Care, which will never be wanting to his true Religion, ſhall think it neceſſary by this means to recover and reſtore it, let this Fiery Tryal come, let it come.</p>
               <p>And then, I doubt not, but we ſhall have our <gap reason="foreign">

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Now render you my hearty thanks for your free adviſe, you gave me concerning the publiſhing of the Argument, for the Biſhops Right of Judging in Capital Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Parliament, and for aſſerting their civil Honors and Rights in the Government. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath given me an occaſion, both of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the moſt of the Inferiour Clergy, from thoſe Imputations which you have remembred to me, and are commonly diſcourſed to their diſadvantage, whereby they have loſt their Eſteem with the People, and alſo of rectifying the miſtakes of ſome; for their number is not great, who have given too much cauſe therein of publick complaints.</p>
            <p>You diſwade me from giving any aſſiſtance to the Rights of the preſent Biſhops; for, that the Clergy out of whom the Biſhops muſt be made, have entertained Principles that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Government. They affirm (you ſay) <hi>That it is in the power of a Prince, by Divine Right, to govern as he pleaſeth, that the power of the Laws is ſolely in him; that he may if he pleaſe, uſe the conſent of Parliaments to aſſiſt the reaſon of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56755:140"/> his Laws, when he ſhall give any, but it is great condeſcention in Kings to give a reaſon for what they do, and a diminution to their moſt unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Prerogative.</hi> You ſay, <hi>That they are for a Popiſh Succeſſor and no Parliament, and do as much as in them lies, give up our antient Government and the Proteſtant Religion, the true Chriſtian Faith to the abſolute will of a Popiſh Succeſſor, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him a Divine Right to extirpate God</hi>'s <hi>true Religion eſtabliſhed amongst us by Law, and to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate our Government by his abſolute pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Government by a King and Eſtates of Parliament, is as antient as any thing can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred of the Nation. The attempt of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in all ages accounted treaſon, and the puniſhment thereof reſerved to the Parliament by 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. The conſervancy of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being not ſafely to be lodg'd any where, but with the government it ſelf. Offences of this kind not pardonable by the King, becauſe it is not in his power to change it. This is our Government, and thus it is eſtabliſhed, and for ages and immemorial time hath thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a long Succeſſion of Kings have recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed it to be ſuch; And juſt now when we are under the dread of a Popiſh Succeſſor, ſome of our Clergy are illuminated into a myſtery, that hath been concealed from the beginning of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments to this day, from the wiſdom of all Princes and Miniſters of State. <hi>That any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Government not derived from the King,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56755:140"/> and that is not to yield to his abſolute Will, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and againſt the Divine Right and Authority of Kings in the Eſtabliſhment, againſt which no uſage or preſcription to the contrary, or in abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, is to be allowed. That all Rights are ambulatory, and depend for their continuance upon his pleaſure. So that though the Reformation was made here by the Government eſtabliſhed by Law, and hath acquired civil Rights not to be altered, but by the King and the three Eſtates. Theſe men yet ſpeak (ſay you) as if they envied the Rights of their own Religion, and had a mind to reduce the Church back again into a ſtate and condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecuted, and deſigned ſhe ſhould be ſtript of her Legal Immunities and Defenſatives, and brought back to the deplorable helpleſs condition of Prayers and Tears, do utterly abandon and neglect all the Proviſions that God</hi>'s <hi>providence hath made for her protection. Nay, by this their new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, they put it by Divine Right into the power of a Popiſh Succeſſor; when he pleaſeth at once by a ſingle indiſputable and irreſiſtable Edict, to deſtroy our Religion and Government.</hi> And theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you ſay, they are the more inclined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain; For, <hi>That they believe no Plot, but a Presbyterian Plot;</hi> for, <hi>of them they believe all ill, and call whom they pleaſe by that hated name, and boldly avow that Popery is more eligible than Presbytery; for by that they ſhall have greater revenues, and more Authority and Rule over the Lay-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56755:141"/>
            <p>This is a heavy charge if true, but it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable (I am ſure) but to a few, and not ſo generally, as ſome malevolent men of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Faction are induſtriouſly buſie to have it. For if it were, I confeſs, it might choque the conſtancy, Reſolution and Zeal of the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, to the ſervice of the Church men, and make them at leaſt very indifferent in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. For theſe miſtakes are ſo groſs and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, that they ought to be permitted to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſmart of their own follies, and to be corrected by the evils they are drawing down upon themſelves, with their own hands. They deſerve to ſuffer as betrayers of their own Country, and to be proſecuted with greater ſhame and ignominy, by all of the Reformed Religion, than the <hi>Traditores</hi> were by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Chriſtians. Theſe their diſerting of the true Chriſtian Faith, being much leſs excuſable then that of theirs, and of greater miſchief, as of deeper malignity.</p>
            <p>How many of the Clergy-men are thus miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led we know not, but they ſeem many more than they are, becauſe they are moſt in view, and come often under obſervation, frequent publick houſes, and talk loud, becauſe they want the Complement of their preferments.</p>
            <p>But certainly Sir, what you ſay to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared opinions of ſome Clergy-men, is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs now of the Papiſts to propagate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hoc Ithacus velit &amp; magno mercantur Atridae.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56755:141"/>
            <p>Theſe are agreeable to, and indeed make up the moſt modern Project and Schem of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot.</p>
            <p>Since the diſcovery of their firſt deſign of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King, and maſſacring of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. They have taken ſuch courage by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving how little power we have to prevent their deſign, that they have us in ſcorn, and in the vileſt contempt.</p>
            <p>They now think that we are not worth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, but by our own hands, that we are not worthy of their trouble, or the charge of Executioners of their providing. How enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining is it to his Holineſs, to find the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the impregnable Bulwark of the Reformed Religion, eaſily fall into his hands, by the unpreſidented folly of ſome of her Sons, without the trouble of attacking her, either by force or Argument, which hath hitherto wanted ſucceſs, and the attempts always atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with diſhonor, and miſchief to his See. How pleaſant will it be to him to ſee us periſh, and our deſtruction to be from our ſelves. With this he will anſwer all the irrefragable Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the Communion of the Romiſh Church. Then he will ſay with triumph, our Church deſtroyed her ſelf, and periſhed by a <hi>Divine Fate,</hi> for her unwarrantable and Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Schiſm; for ſo he will call our <hi>follies,</hi> and impute them to Divine infatuations. The
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56755:142"/> manner of our deſtruction will be a better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and of more force againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Reformation, than all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all the Doctors of that Church to this day.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, ſince the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, it is that Sir <hi>Robert Filmers</hi> Books were Re-printed together, and recommended by the Title Page and the publick Gazet to our reading. Since the Diſcovery of the Plot, we have had variety of Books Printed to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>viz. To prove that all Kings as Kings are abſolute by Divine Right.</hi> Since the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, we have had men imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſearch all our antient Records and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to find out ſomething more antient than our Parliaments as now conſtituted, that it may ſerve as a pretence to take them away. Since the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, we have the memory of our late calamitous War revived, to raiſe a Pannick fear of another, and to make the King believe that the genius of the Nation is Rebellious, and that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion it ſelf is to be apprehended by Kings.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to tell how that late unhappy War began, or how it came to iſſue ſo Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in the Death of the Late King, though we know how it ended, <hi>viz.</hi> The Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered within twelve years after the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored Death of that excellent King into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56755:142"/> Loyalty, and in ſpight of a great Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Power, never before foil'd, ever victorious, then kept on foot for the intereſt of a very few men, reſtored our preſent King (may his Reign be long and happy) to the Government of his Kingdoms, without the leaſt aſſiſtance of any of the Cavalier party, and oblig'd a wary Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in the head of a factious and republican ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Loyalty.</p>
            <p>Nay within that time alſo, the Nation had recovered out of their partial Lapſe into Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme, bread up great numbers of excellent Schollars, who maſterd the prejudices of thoſe times, were reverenced by the chief of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian party, and are the beauty and ſtrength of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at this time.</p>
            <p>The Presbyterians themſelves were grown reconcileable to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and had learnt by woful experience the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs of Schiſme, upon no better pretences than what then might have been ſatisfied and accommodated.</p>
            <p>When the King and Church were reſtored, Fanaticiſme had expired, if ſome old peeviſh and ſtiff Church-men had not ſtudied obſtacles againſt a univerſal accommodation, and ſome crafty Stateſmen had not projected that the continuance of the Schiſme would be of great ſervice ſome time or other, to deſtroy the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and change our antient Government, which is now apparently the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56755:143"/> Plot, and if ever it be effected, it will be with this trick of affrighting the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the apprehenſion of Fanaticiſme, and making them ſuſpicious of Parliaments. As many of them as are drawn into an opinion of the diſloyalty of our late Parliaments, the illuſions of the Popiſh Plot hath paſſed upon them, and they are under the power of its faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. But both the Loyalty of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and alſo how much it imports the Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to have it believed that they deſign upon the preſent Government, will at once be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood; if it be conſidered what hath been done for the forging of a Proteſtant Plot, (which was intended at the firſt opening to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Houſe of Commons) Things ſo wicked as would make a virtuous man aſhamed of the age he lives in. But after all endeavors to find witneſſes for their purpoſe, powerful encouragements and great rewards, they have drawn none into their aſſiſtance, but who are publickly known for Rogues, or who wanted Bread, or had no Reputation to looſe. If the falſhood of this forged Plot had not been utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable, they might have procured bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeeming, and more credible witneſſes. They might ſure have found in this age men bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, not already infamous to have teſtified a probable Lye. But ſo neceſſary it is to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh deſign, that a Proteſtant Plot be believed that they are not diſcouraged at the manifeſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56755:143"/> detection of their conſpiracies, perjuries and ſubornations; but will ſtill go on as if they had a power to work miracles of villany for their Religion, which is no better. Our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Politicians have been moſt obſervant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to their virtuous make; how frauds, perjuries and violence have proſpered, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in ſome particular caſes, and have brought about ſome deſigns, imagine ſuch means throughly multiplied, to be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all things which they deſign. But theſe Arts which have had ſucceſs by the permiſſion of God, when one Villain hath been to deſtroy another, will not paſs upon the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Let them ſeriouſly in time deſpair, and give over ſuch enterpriſes, <hi>For there is no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>nor Divination againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Lot of Gods inheritance, and his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Care.</hi> If <hi>Mordecai</hi> be of the Seed of the Jews, <hi>Haman</hi> ſhall fall before him. It is matter of comfort to us, and diſpair to the Plotters, that not one of their Plots yet, but hath proved Abortive, or they have been defeated by their very ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Beſides, pray let it be obſerved how this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of leſſening our juſt confidence in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is otherwiſe carried on and promoted. It is now become the principal buſineſs of the Mercenary Writers for the Plot, to pick up and cull out all the enormities and irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe times, the <hi>Vitia temporum,</hi> and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of wild pranks of ſome beaſtly Fanatical
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56755:144"/> people, that exceeded the common degeneracy of thoſe ill times, into which the Nation by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicernable degrees ſo fouly lapſed, to make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of an ugly Vizard, and this they clap unduly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on four fifths of the Nation, upon all that love and adhere to our Government and Religion, to render them ſuſpected of deſtroying again the Engliſh Monarchy and the Proteſtant Religion, even for thoſe very proceedings that they make for preſerving both. For the ſervice of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery requires, that whoſoever oppoſes it muſt be branded with Treaſon and Fanaticiſme; that ſuch delicate perſons as are fond of the name of Loyalty, though they underſtand not in what it conſiſts; that hate the name of Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, ſince it is become as common a name of reproach, as the <hi>Son of a Whore;</hi> though they underſtand not ſo well what it means, will be ſure ſo to behave themſelves, as to be reckoned for Loyal and not Fanatical, by taking the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the one and the other, according to the new notion of the Plot Writers, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come theirs with all their idle prattle. But let them make their beſt of this fooliſh ſort of men, if that was all they could effect by this project.</p>
            <p>But they deſign further upon the Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> to match the fears of Popery, with a fear as great of the like Evils to thoſe of Forty one, as if theſe Plotters had power by their intereſt to raiſe a new War, when we have power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in our Government, if it were exerted,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56755:144"/> to deſtroy them by Juſtice. But theſe State Mountebanks think it convenient, becauſe the Nation was caſt into a Frenzy in Forty one; therefore now when in perfect health, we are to be caſt into a Lethargy to prevent our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, and in the mean time they intend we ſhould periſh inſenſibly and quietly, that way they deſign to deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>It is ſince the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, that Popiſh Mercenaries have been hired to write virulent Libels againſt the Church, and bitter invectives againſt Fanaticks. Out of the ſame Mint came a villanous Libel, called <hi>Omnia Comeſta a Belo</hi> againſt the Church, apt to render the Church-men ſuſpicious of another deteſtable Sacriledge deſigned. And that loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Print entitled the <hi>Committee</hi> or <hi>Popery in Maſquerade.</hi> Many parts whereof hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon of belief, but that they have been the Subject of ſome drunken Rhimes in former times, but it is in the whole an inſufferable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt the Nation by its application to this age.</p>
            <p>Theſe Mercenaries are the Authors as well of treaſonable Libels againſt the King which they forme, ſo as they may ſeem to come from the Fanatick party, to render the King jealous of them, as they are of the Libels againſt the Parliament and their proceedings, to breed miſunderſtandings between the King, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and People.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56755:145"/>
            <p>It is ſince the Popiſh Plot was diſcovered, that Fanaticiſme is repreſented more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than Popery. That the Popiſh Plot evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the ſatisfaction of the King and ſeveral Parliaments, and of our greateſt Judicatures, is yet told us not to be ſo certain, as that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks are Traitors in their hearts, though they own no principles as the Papiſts do that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Treaſonable practices. And theſe Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries as frankly, as if they had for the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Nation a Warrant ſo to do, call all Fanaticks that oppoſe Popery, deſire Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and expect they ſhould uſe that power that is lodged in them, to keep out Popery, and preſerve our Government, and to bring to puniſhment thoſe wicked men, that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly deſigned to deſtroy it. The belief of the Popiſh Plot in the mean time, is by ſcoffs and paltry Rhimes, permitted publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſung in the Streets, put out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and thoſe that believe it expoſed as a ſort of credulous Fools, or deſigning Knaves.</p>
            <p>Such a vile eſteem the Papiſts now have of us, that they proſecute us with their ſcorn, and uſe us as if we were below their hate. They think our diviſions which they have made have already deſtroyed us; and they now hire a ſort of <hi>Scaramouchy Zanys, Merry An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> and <hi>Jack-Puddings</hi> to inſult over us, and make ſport at our miſeries.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56755:145"/>
            <p>Theſe pleaſant Knaves cry with one ſide of the Face, and laugh with the other, but in the mean time they cry in jeſt, but laugh in good earneſt. He that had the art of imitating a grave Spaniard with one ſide of his body, and a brisk <hi>French</hi> man on the other ſide rendred both Nations ridiculous.</p>
            <p>Theſe vain fellows deprave every thing they meddle with, and what ever they ſay of Church or State, Religion or Policy, is raillery and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe and Pamphleting ſcurrility.</p>
            <p>Lord under what ſeeming fatality do we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, that it can be thought to the Service of the Church or State, to employ ſuch Knaves.</p>
            <p>We are uſed like <hi>Samſon</hi> bound, and our Eyes put out, and made ſport for the <hi>Philiſtims.</hi> By theſe pyd Pipers, our young men are ſeduced, and danc'd down a precipice, though theſe merry Knaves have not skill enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them for Rat-catchers; if our City ſhould be infeſted with that vermin, as they ſay the Town of <hi>Hammel</hi> once was. But the Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that appeared there a pyd Piper who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd their Children as well as their Rats, was not more miſchievous to that Town, than theſe motley Knaves are to the Kingdom and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It is an inſufferable indignity, that the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical State of our Nation ſhould become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt daily the matter of a Raſcally Farſe; the very anguiſh and groans of the Nation turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56755:146"/> into Laughter and Mockery, ſuch a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was never uſed to a Nation.</p>
            <p>It is an exceſs of Petulancy, to make abſtract miſery in the very form of it, mimically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented matter of Mirth and Laughter.</p>
            <p>Theſe men were born out of time, and were fit for no age but that of <hi>Nero,</hi> of whoſe conſort they ſhould have been, when he play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Deſtruction of Troy,</hi> to the Burning of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I do not doubt but His Majeſties Juſtice will e're long overtake theſe incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that are ſo pleaſant at the embroilment of his Kingdom, when it ſhall be duly repreſented to him what beautefeau's they are, and unmerciful deriders of the Calamities of his People, which they occaſion or promote, tho they think they may paſs any thing of this kind upon the Nation made vain, with trifling falſe wit and Buffoonery.</p>
            <p>It is now Twenty years ſince our Nation was infected with this ſort of wit, and now we are to dye of the diſeaſe, and we have a Fiddle provided for us that have been bit with this venemous <hi>Tarantula,</hi> to dance and frisk us to our deſtruction not to our cure, and yet we pay the Fidler. This thing wit, the greateſt debauchment of this age hath depraved not only the manners, but the Judgment and underſtanding of the Nation too. It hath been accounted the beſt accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men in place, the beſt part of the Learning of this laſt Age: It is not the reaſon of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> ſo much as the vanity of wit,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56755:146"/> that hath propogated atheiſm and corrupted our manners. This hath made our Judgments inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and trifling, and our determinate reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of the greateſt moment ſlight and Phantaſtical introduc't idleneſs and neglect of ſolid Learning, which requires labor and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to obtain, while this extemporary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty has been accounted an admired accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.</p>
            <p>There is a ſort of wit very commendable which <hi>Tully</hi> calls <hi>celeritas in verbis,</hi> and the Greek Epigram, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is a pleaſant entertainment in converſation, and a commendable refreſhment, where our minds are tired with anxious and graver buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the troubles and cares of human life, but this ought to obſerve its times, its proper ſubjects, it ought to be confined to Table talk, an evening compotation, and the hours of mirth, and the relaxation of our mind: It may be uſed decently in a Comical Farce; but it is not allowable in <hi>Satyr,</hi> moſt undecent is the uſe of it in Tragedy. But yet it hath inſolently interpoſed in our Politicks, governed publick Councels, ſometimes determined debates in Parliament, hath made our Pulpits contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, our Theology trifling: It is admitted to reſolve the greateſt Queſtions and determine Caſes of Conſcience, to eſtabliſh and refix Church Gevernment, hath uſurped, an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to alter and pull down Governments, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56755:147"/> to render them tottering, when they are as firmly eſtabliſht and fixt as a Rock.</p>
            <p>That Wit that is abhorred by all men that are wiſe and honeſt, is that verſatile ſhifting, ſquinting, diſtorting of the underſtanding, that it views nothing truly and repreſents things not according to their true nature, but under falſe Fantaſtical Schemes, which they affix to them to abuſe the judgments of others, a man can never arrive to any perfection in this faculty, untill he is become falſe, and loſt his truth and modeſty, and none but weak men are entertained with it, and ſuch who do not deſire to underſtand truth, but to ſerve a turn and love to be deceived, and deceive themſelves for advantage, it is in perfection in old Knaves, and admired by young Coxcombs: It is the Hypocriſie of the Tongue, a plauſible mode of lying and ſlandring, and at beſt but a pleaſant Knavery.</p>
            <p>It will render ridiculous or culpable by falſe repreſentations the moſt noble and heroical a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and put falſe colors upon moſt deteſtable Villanies. It can diſcredit a man by honoring him, and make a thing incredible by the very mode of believing it, making a man ridiculous, it concludes him at the ſame time unworthy, and to confute the moſt avowed Truths, there needs no more than to raiſe a fit of laughter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, which has the ſame effect with the men of Wit, and their vain admirers as reducing a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56755:147"/> falſe propoſition to an abſurdity: Thus the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this age is governed by our riſibility. The Popiſh Writers have thus tickled us with their Wit, that we are ready to dye and periſh laughing, and we know not, nor care to Judge what does truly concern our preſervation. And by improving the vanity of ſome youngſters, they have drawn them to queſtion the Truth of the Popiſh Plot, and ſome can believe every hour of the day when they meet with a merry Popiſh Pamphlet that there is a Proteſtant Plot on foot; though they believe it, I am ſure not much longer than they are reading it.</p>
            <p>I will not grudge my pains in furniſhing a ſhort Demonſtration of the Popiſh Plot, ſince it is of ſuch importance to the ſaving of theſe men and the whole Nation, which poſſibly may fix their minds (notwithſtanding ſo vain they be) into a belief of it, which I have made ſhort that it may be the better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, which I do in kindneſs to them, ſince it was lately (and may be ſo again ſhortly) a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal matter to bring the truth of it into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and they are by all honeſt men reckoned as Plotters themſelves who doubt it.</p>
            <p>The Plot has been declared by the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and four Parliaments, one of them conſiſting of Penſioners and Dependents on the Court, which for eighteen years together, were giving Demonſtrations of their Loyalty to their Prince, almoſt forgetting the publick
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56755:148"/> Weal: A ſolemn National Faſt has been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Kingdom, for averting the miſchiefs thereby deſigned, and ſolemnly Celebrated by the whole Nation, in which certainly they did not mock God and deride his providence.</p>
            <p>Many unparalleld Villanies have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for the ſtifling, concealing and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the diſcovery of it, which (however wicked the Papiſtical ſort of baſe, falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Chriſtians are) we cannot without breach of Charity towards them, think they would commit cheaply, and without cauſe, and to no purpoſe. They have murdered a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Juſtice, becauſe he had the knowledge of it, and left nothing undone that they thought neceſſary to Aſſacinate another for ſtrenuouſly oppoſing it. They have attempted upon the Lives of our Witneſſes, by perjuries and forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they have endeavored to charge them with the moſt infamous crimes, endeavored to deſtroy them in their Lives and Reputations too in a forme of Juſtice. They have attempted by fears and rewards upon the integrity of all our Witneſſes, to draw them to retract their Teſtimony againſt the Plot, for which ſome of their Agents have been judicially cenſured; One Gentleman to the Pillory, Fined a 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and Condemned to a years impriſonment, ſo evident and notorious was his offence, and by the Court thought ſo heinous: That it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56755:148"/> the paſſion of the Court, and they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exceed the ordinary Rules of Juſtice, for that they judged the Caſe to be of an exorbitant and tranſcendent nature. The Plot of the <hi>Meal Tub</hi> is ſo ſublimated a piece of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the laſt accompliſhment of villany, it hath out-done all former, and will never be out-done in after ages. The Papiſts by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the firſt Plot became leſs hopeful in a Maſſacre, and of effecting their purpoſe by force: They dare not now kill the King, for that the World would not now believe it to be done by Mr. <hi>Claypole</hi> and his accomplices, which muſt have born the blame from the Papiſts, and he and they long ſince Executed as Traitors, if that part of the Plot againſt the Kings Life, had not been prevented by being detected.</p>
            <p>I ſay the firſt deſign of the Plot being rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red leſs feaſible by the diſcovery, they keep the King alive with care as well for their avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rage of the Nation, as to leſſen the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Plot: But contrive to deſtroy as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as they thought fit to be Maſſacred in forme of a legal proceſs, and to charge them with a deſign of raiſing Rebellion againſt the King: They had made a Liſt of a great number, whom they intended to charge principal Nobles and worthy Gentlemen about the Town, had prepared witneſſes to ſwear the charge againſt them, and would with more eaſe after the firſt Conviction and Execution, have ſworn all that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56755:149"/> they had a mind to deſtroy into the ſame guilt. And thus all the truly Religious, the noble, good and virtuous of our Nation, that had courage enough to own, aſſert and defend the true Chriſtianity, and our Government muſt to the eternal diſhonor of our Nation and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, have ſuffered the execrable death of Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. We have reaſon to think them humane, when they only deſigned a <hi>Gun-powder Treaſon</hi> or a Maſſacre, and our abhorrence of this uſage diſchargeth in us all reluctancy to Martyrdom: Let them bring us to the Stake as Martyrs, then we ſhall bear our Teſtimony to the truth of the beſt Religion, and our Lives will not be cheaply loſt; but by this means we muſt be forced to diſhonor this Religion by our deaths, by a Maſſacre or a Gun-powder Plot, the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cruelty and treachery of that Apoſtate Church, had been declared to all the World, and that falſe Religion, as well as the profeſſors of it, had been rendered deteſtable, for which end a good man would ſcarce refuſe to dye, but by this means they would have forced us to perſonate their own proper Crimes and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, and diſhonor our own peaceable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion: A man of Honor prefers his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to his Life, and would redeem it by his Death: But by this means we were, though innocent to loſe our Lives by diſhonor, and to faſten a ſtain upon our Memories by our death. The Prieſts, their impudent Lyes at their deaths
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56755:149"/> in denying the matters of the Plot, of which they were upon clear evidence Convicted and Sentenced, muſt have paſt for truths, and all our worthy men dying with proteſtations of their innocence, muſt to the everlaſting infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of our Religion and Nation, been account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falſe and impious at their laſt breath, there is no reaſon to be aſſign'd of the patience of God or Man towards ſuch miſcreants, but that they may have time to add one impiety to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until an eaſie vengeance triumphs over them; for though this laſt mentioned Plot is cleared beyond all exception, their Faces are hardened, and they are not yet aſhamed; but have ſince contrived and ſuborned Witneſſes to ſwear the very Diſcovery of the firſt Plot to be a falſe contrivance of a Plot againſt the Papiſts. To this purpoſe they ſuborned a Son by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to commit parricide againſt his Father, the greateſt Sin againſt Earth, the other the greateſt affront againſt Heaven; What a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this that muſt be thus ſupported!</p>
            <p>Nay, as if they did not fear or care to looſe the favour of their moſt indulgent Prince, which they have poſſeſt ſince he choſe to truſt them rather than his Proteſtant Subjects, in making his eſcape at <hi>Worceſter;</hi> they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived theſe two laſt Plots with ſuch Art, as to bring them under His Majeſties obſervation, and repreſented them as things fit for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement: Sure if they were not urged
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56755:150"/> with the fears of a real guilt, and a reſtleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Plot, they would never have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured thus to have intereſted the honor of the King, and to tempt him to abandon them to the publick Juſtice of the Nation, which begins to grow impatient by the delays of it againſt this Helliſh Plot: For we have had four Parliaments diſſolved ſince the Diſcovery of it, one a darling to the Crown. The bringing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to queſtion the Diſſolution of that Parliament in the Houſe of Peers, upon the reaſon of an unnatural Prorogation, was not long before cenſured, and ſome great Lords impriſoned, therefore proceeding ſo unwarrantable, that it was after thought fit by that Houſe to oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Memory of them; ſo neceſſary was that Parliament then thought to the ſervice of the Crown. The Diſſolution of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gave us reaſon to fear that the King had no more buſineſs for Parliaments. By theſe Diſſolutions, no publick ends that are intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible are ſerved, no intereſt is gratified, no perſons of any ſort receive their ſatisfaction but the Plotters, and the Plot are reſpited thereby from publick Juſtice, and gain time to bring the Plot to effect.</p>
            <p>This is the end the Papiſts have ſerved, but the King our great Phyſician of State, had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon that hath governed him, for he knew the ſtrength of the Plot, our Diſeaſe, and that a Diſeaſe that is dangerous, is ſometimes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56755:150"/> to be palliated until the ſeaſon comes to make a thorow Cure, for it many times kills the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to precipitate the Criſis; all theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the Plot are paſt under every mans obſervation.</p>
            <p>But that we know ſo little of it after all this time: It is now above three years ſince the firſt diſcovery, that the Plotters now ordinarily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape Juſtice. That a great Judge did abate his firſt Zeal in puniſhing the Plot, leaſt he ſhould exaſperate it, and Reaſon of State might thus require it.</p>
            <p>Theſe things prove the greatneſs and ſtrength of the Plot as well as the reality of it, theſe declare the Plotters intereſt is great, that the Plot is yet unbroken, ſtanch and hopeful, and therefore we are not to believe our ſelves well, and live <hi>ſine Regimine</hi> as the Phyſicians ſay, but to expect addreſs to and deſire our Cure. And that the Papiſts think it yet hopeful, is evident from the Prieſts and the Lawyer, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring their guilt with their laſt breath. We had the honeſt Confeſſions of the Convicted Prieſts and other Traitors, of the Popiſh Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of which they ſtood Convicted in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and in the time of King <hi>James,</hi> of the Gun-powder Treaſon. What then could induce our Plotters Convict, to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moſt ſolemn perjuries the next minute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were to appear to God? nothing ſure but that they then hoped that the Plot might
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56755:151"/> be executed; they did it for the intereſt and ſervice of their Church, and for the better bringing it to effect: For which they dyed, and for which at their deaths, to conceal, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured Heroically upon lyes and perjuries, which if confeſſed would have been fruſtrated and become Abortive: For it muſt not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that that Church is ſo degenerate, as to permit and allow men to ſuch impieties, for the punctilio's of honor, though of the Church it ſelf: But while they are not done for the ſake of him that commits them, but for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant intereſt of their Church, (ſuch as the carrying on of this Plot) they ſay they looſe their nature by the direction of the intention, they become a pure piece of mortification and ſelf denyal, an adventure to truſt God in what they do for his ſake, and for his ſervice; and their Caſuiſts will no more call them in this Caſe lyes or perjuries, than <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering up his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> (though that was at Gods expreſs command) was murder. But the God of Truth, that God who hath declared, that when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any entercourſe with Mankind interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an Oath, that the matter under that Oath is irrevocable, peremptory and abſolute, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not licenſe or diſpenſe with perjurious falſhoods for any end whatſoever.</p>
            <p>But I muſt remark one thing more, and that is, touching the credit of Dr. <hi>Titus Oats,</hi> and Capt. <hi>William Bedloe,</hi> viz. That they have been
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56755:151"/> incurious in their converſation, have followed their own natural courſe, allowed themſelves in their paſſions, have been apert and unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, have not cared who they offended, have ſought no mans favour, ſeem to care for no mans opinion, have valued and ſupported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only by their veracity, and have ſeemed to ſet all the World at defiance to find a flaw in their evidence, and have had little of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or eſteem, but for the ſake of their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Beſides that ſo long a time hath not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a poſſibility by all the Artifice, Intereſt and unhallowed frauds of <hi>Rome,</hi> to falſify any one part of that evidence. But numberleſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents have given credit and authentickneſs to their Teſtimony: Did ever any feigned Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony bear it ſelf up with ſo much Confidence, Bravery and Aſſurance? was there ever any falſe witneſs that did not endeavour to render himſelf acceptable, to beſpeak favour which draws after it eredit, and to appear of the moſt unexceptionable behaviour? Their faults and imprudences ſuch as they have been, we would not have wanted to make their evidence beyond all exception.</p>
            <p>The undoubted truth of their evidence alone, hath given them the civil reſpect of all honeſt men, and will give the Doctor the publick ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Nation in due time. I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the innumerable Sham-plots contrived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants, every one of them a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56755:152"/> by it ſelf of the trurh of the Popiſh Plot, becauſe I have no deſign to exaſperate, but awaken theſe men that are aſleep and ſecure in this ſtorme.</p>
            <p>This trouble of demonſtrating of the Plot, may ſeem unneceſſary to the judicious, nay to the plain ſort of honeſt, upright and well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men; and ſo it would certainly have been, had not ſome young Gentlemen by this paltry thing called Wit, been corrupted in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and brought into a Scepticiſme, and wild undetermination in a matter of ſo great concernment.</p>
            <p>This deſpicable faculty hath made a famous Gentleman, who hath a liberal doſe of it, a Writer of Books cauſed him to waſte ſo much Paper, and abuſe ſo many Readers; but in all that I have read of him, there is nothing true and ſincere, or truly and ſincerely ſaid, his Judgment is made falſe by his Phantaſie, or he hath ſerv'd a turn by his Verſatile windings and Wily conceits. That dangerous faculty that he indulgeth hath impoſed upon him, which the ſevere and honeſt enquirers after truth, are concerned to mortify and ſuppreſs. And I do earneſtly recommend to all ingenious Gentlemen that would be rightly inſtructed and informed, neither deceive others, nor would be deceived themſelves, as they love truth and virtue, wiſdom and ſober thoughts, to diſpiſe this ſort of wit in others, and repreſs it in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56755:152"/> themſelves: And never allow it to be uſed, but in the hours of mirth, in the Relaxations of their minds from ſerious Contemplations and matters grave and weighty, where this prophane thing wit ought always to be ſhut out with care.</p>
            <p>Enough hath been ſaid for rectifying the miſtakes of any true Proteſtant, eſpecially any Clergy-man of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which you have objected againſt them about Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Parliament, diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Popery. Eſpecially when it is made apparent that theſe miſtakes are made ſerviceable to the Popiſh Plot, and the means which that party proſecute to compaſs and bring about the ruine of our Church. But that nothing may be wanting, that lyes in my poor power, for pulling their Foot out of the Snare, I ſhall more diſtinctly conſider them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall deſire them to conſider what our Government is, and where the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it is to be found: And where can it be found, but in our Statute Books, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of our Law, the Hiſtories of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of the Kingdom. Search them if you be at leiſure, if you are not, conſult thoſe that have read them, and whoſe buſineſs and employment it is to underſtand them, and you cannot fail to be informed.</p>
            <p>That the King hath no power to make Laws,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56755:153"/> that both Houſes of Parliament muſt joyn with the King in making a Law.</p>
            <p>It can with no more reaſon be concluded that the King hath the Legiſlative power, becauſe his Aſſent makes the Bills in Parliament Laws, than it can becauſe the third Unit added to two makes a Triad, that the other two do not go to the making of that number, when a matter's moved from the King in Parliament to paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Law the Commons conſent laſt. The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents of <hi>Ed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>E. Cook</hi> 8: R.</note> 3. for making the Eldeſt Son of a King in Succeſſion Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi> was confirmed (as there muſt have been, otherwiſe they would have been void) by the Houſe of Commons. And yet we will not ſay, that the Houſe of Commons can make a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> or Duke of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> And yet upon no better reaſon than this, ſome men will talk as if they believed themſelves, that the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative power is in the King, when no King of <hi>England</hi> yet ever pretended to it; but by their proceſs of Law have puniſhed ſuch officious and miſchievous Knaves.</p>
            <p>They will tell you that the Laws are the meaſures of our Allegiance, and the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and declare the terms of Obedience and Government.</p>
            <p>That a Legiſlative authority is neceſſary to every Government, and therefore we ought not to want it; and therefore Parliaments in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56755:153"/> which our Government hath placed the making of Laws, cannot be long diſcontinued, nor their Conventions rendred illuſory and in vain, which is all one as to want them.</p>
            <p>That to Govern by Laws implieth that great fundamental Law, that new Laws ſhall be made upon new emergencies, and for avoiding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable miſchiefs to the State. By the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 14.36. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. it is provided that Parliaments be holden once every year. The Statute of this King required a Parliament every three years, which being an affirmatory Law, doth not derogate from thoſe of <hi>Ed.</hi> the 3. But if the King doth not call a Parliament once in a year, He neglects theſe Laws, and if he delays calling a Parliament three years, he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the other Law of his own time to. And for that he is by the Law intruſted with the calling of Parliaments, He is at liberty to call them within the times appointed. And that Laws ought to be made for Redreſs of miſchiefs that may enſue, appears by the Statute of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. In which we have theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereupon the Commons have prayed our ſaid So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord the King, that ſith the right of the Crown of England, and the Law of the ſaid Realm is ſuch, that upon the miſchiefs &amp; Dammage which happeneth to this Realm, he ought and is bound of the Accord of his ſaid People in his Parliament thereof, to make Remedy and Law in avoiding the miſchief and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which whereof cometh,</hi> which that King agreed to by his Royal Aſſent thereto given.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56755:154"/>
            <p>I dare be bold to ſay, that never any Bill in Parliament was loſt, and wanted the Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that was promoted by the general deſires of the people.</p>
            <p>If Popery therefore (which is the greateſt miſchief to us that ever threatned this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) can be kept out by a Law, we ought to have ſuch a Law, and nothing can hinder ſuch a Law to be paſt for that purpoſe, but want of an univerſal deſire to have it. I deſire theſe Gentlemen to conſider how they will anſwer it to their Saviour at the laſt day, if they ſuffer his true Religion, and the profeſſors of it to be deſtroyed and perſecuted, when nothing but their deſires of a thing lawful to be had, and of right due, was requiſite to prevent it. Their ſufferings will be juſt and righteous from God, if their ſin occaſioneth it, and very uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to themſelves.</p>
            <p>The extent of the Legiſlative authority, is no where to be underſtood, but by our Acts of Parliament in which it hath been exerciſed and uſed, and by ſuch Acts that declare the extent of its power, by the 13. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. it is made Treaſon during that Queens Life, and forfeiture of Goods and Chattels afterwards. <hi>To hold, maintain and affirm, that the Queen by the Authority of the Parliament of England, is not able to make Laws and Statutes of ſufficient force and validity, to limit and bind the Crown of this Realm, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, limitation, inheritance and Government thereof.</hi> And this authority was exerciſed by Entailing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56755:154"/> the Crown in Parliaments, in the times of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th. <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th. <hi>Richard</hi> the 3d. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. thrice in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. and upon the Marriage of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> both the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were Entailed, whereby it was provided that of the ſeveral Children to be begotten upon the Queen, one was to have the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> another <hi>Spain,</hi> another the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> The Articles of Marriage to this purpoſe were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are truly Loyal to our preſent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, have reaſon to recognize with high ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that ſuch a power of altering and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting the deſcent of the Crown, is duly lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the King and States of the Realm: For under the authority of an Act of Parliament of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> we derive our ſelves to the happineſs of his Government, and and He his title to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which drew to him the Imperial Crown of <hi>England.</hi> For <hi>Robert Steward</hi> firſt King of <hi>Scotland</hi> of that Family, lived in concubinate with <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> and by her had three Sons, <hi>John, Robert</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> afterwards he Married <hi>Eufame</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and after was Crowned King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> He had by her <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Straherne.</hi> When <hi>Eufame</hi> his Wife dyed, he Married <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Mure.</hi> After that by one Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56755:155"/> he made them firſt Noble, that is to ſay, <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Carrick, Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Menteith,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Buchquhane.</hi> And ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after by another Parliament, he limited the Crown in Tail Succeſſively to <hi>John, Robert</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> his Children by <hi>Elizabeth Mure</hi> in Concubinate, and after to the Children of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Roſs</hi> his Legitimate Children; who are to this day in their iſſue by this limitation, by authority of an Act of Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> barr'd from the Crown, and we hope ever will be, by the continuance of the Line of our moſt Gracious King. For note, that though a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Marriage by the civil Law, which is the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in ſuch caſes doth Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the Children born before Marriage, of a Concubine; yet it is with this exception, that they ſhall not be Legitimated to the prejudice of Children born <hi>afterwards</hi> in Marriage, and before the Marriage of the Concubine. Beſides the reaſon of the Civil Law in Legitimating the Children upon a ſubſequent Marriage, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> a preſumption that they were begotten <hi>affectu maritali,</hi> which preſumption fails where the man proceeds to Marry another woman, and abandons or neglects his Concubine.</p>
            <p>But I deſire theſe Gentlemen that are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be ſafe in their Religion, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is moſt dear unto them.</p>
            <p>That if any Law ſhould exceed the declared meaſures of the Legiſlative authority, though
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56755:155"/> in ſuch Caſe they may have leave to doubt of the lawfulneſs of ſuch a Law, yet if it be not againſt any expreſs Law of God, they will upon a little conſideration, determin it lawful, if it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Common-weal, for that nothing can be the concerns of men united in any Polity, but may be govern'd and ordered by the Laws of their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, for publick good; for by the reaſon of all political ſocieties,<note place="margin">For further ſatisfaction of the lawfulneſs of the bill of excluſion. See a Book called <hi>The great and weighty Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration conſidered.</hi>
               </note> there is a ſubmiſſion made of all Rights, eſpecially of the Common Rights of that community, to the Government of its own Laws.</p>
            <p>But all this and a hundred times as much will not ſatisfy ſome Gentlemen, of the lawfulneſs of our Government, &amp; the extent of the Legiſlative power of Parliaments; ſince they have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Notion, that Monarchy is <hi>jure divino,</hi> unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in its deſcent by any Law of man, for that it is ſubject to none. That all Kings are alike ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, that their Will is a Law to all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. That Parliaments &amp; the ſtates of the Realm, in their Conventions can be no more than the Monarcks Miniſters acting under and by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, which he may exauctorate and turn out of Office when he pleaſeth. For there can be (ſay they) under the Sun no obliging Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority but that of Kings (to whom God hath given a plenitude of power) and what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from them: That this Divine Abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may Govern, and exerciſe Royal power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56755:156"/> and that it is ſubject to, nor to be abated or reſtrained by any humane inventions or contrivances of men: (however neceſſary and convenient Kings have thought them in former Ages) by ſuch methods and ſuch offices and Officers (of which number the States of the Realm may be, or not be, as Kings ſhall pleaſe) as they ſhall by their abſolute Will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or appoint. <hi>Our Parliaments,</hi> ſay they, <hi>are Rebellious and an Uſurpation upon the unbounded Power of Kings, which belongs to every King as ſuch</hi> jure ordinario, <hi>and by Divine inſtitution. That a mixt Monarchy as ours is, is an Anarchy, and that we are at preſent without a Government, at leaſt ſuch as we ought to have, and which God hath appointed and ordained for us: That we by adhering to the preſent Government are Rebels to God Almighty, and the Kings unlimited Power and Authority under him, which no humane conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no not the Will and Pleaſure of Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can limit or reſtrain. For that</hi> jura ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria &amp; divina non recipiunt modum, <hi>That the Legiſlative Power is ſolely in the King, and that the buſineſs of a Parliament (if they would think of being only what they ought to be) is only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare on the behalf of themſelves and the people (that ſend them for that purpoſe certainly) the obedience that is due from them to ſuch Laws as the K. ſhall make, and that they may be laid aſide wholly when he pleaſeth.</hi> And after all this, what matter's it with them what we ſay, our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56755:156"/> is, hath been, or where the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Authority of the Nation is placed, or how uſed.</p>
            <p>But I deſire theſe Gentlemen to conſider how they come to theſe Notions, upon what reaſon they are grounded. How a Government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by God and Nature for all Mankind, ſhould remain a ſecret to all the wiſe, good, juſt and peaceable men of all Ages. That Kings ſhould not before this have underſtood their Authority, when no pretences are omitted for encreaſe of power and enlargement of Empire. I deſire them to conſider that this ſecret was not diſcovered to the World before the laſt Age, and was a forerunner of our late unnatural War, and is now again revived by the republiſhing of Sir <hi>Robert Filmers</hi> Books, ſince the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot.</p>
            <p>I wiſh they would conſider that the reaſons ought to be as clear and evident as Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that will warrant them to diſcoſt from the ſenſe of all Mankind, in a matter of ſuch weight and moment.</p>
            <p>That to miſtake with confidence and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening in this matter, will be an unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affront to the Common ſenſe of Mankind, and the greateſt Violation of the Laws of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. I deſire that they would conſider and rate the miſchiefs that will certainly enſue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this opinion, and whether a probable reaſon can therefore ſupport it.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:56755:157"/>
            <p>That they would throughly weigh, ponder and examine the Reaſons of theſe bold and new <hi>Dogmata.</hi> For their enquiries ought to be in proportion diligent and ſtrict, as the matter is of moment, and if they are not, their error and miſtake will be very culpable, and the ſin of the error aggravated to the meaſure of the miſchief which it produceth and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>Where is the Charter of Kings from God Almighty to be read or found? for nothing but the declared Will of God can warrant us to deſtroy our Government, or to give up the Rights and Liberties of our people. If they are lawful, I am ſure it is villany to betray them, ſince all political Societies are framed that all may aſſiſt the Common Rights of all. I cannot imagine they can pretend an umbrage from the Holy Scriptures for ſuch unheard of opinions.</p>
            <p>The Jews indeed had a Government, and Laws of Gods framing and appointment, and a King of their own chooſing, and ſuch a King as they deſired by God's permiſſion they had. But their form of Government ought with leſs reaſon to be the Rule of all kingly Governors, becauſe it was a Government choſen by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then the Laws of the Jews ought to be the Laws of all Nations (which they are not) though made and enacted by God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Chriſt would not make himſelf a Judge in a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56755:157"/> private Right ſubmitted to him. He determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the right of the Roman Empire, by the poſſeſſion of Soveraign Authority, and ſuch as the whole world had made it, his Diſciples were obliged to acknowledge it, by their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Submiſſions, which is the ſumm of the Apoſtles Doctrin in this matter.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Religion inſtituted no form of Governments, but enjoyns us to be obedient to thoſe we have, not only by expreſs command in the caſe, but by its general Rules of a moſt refined, improved and extenſive morality.</p>
            <p>But though I ſaid the Scriptures have not preſcribed or directed any univerſal Form of Government, yet the Scripture hath declared the falſhood of this new Hypotheſis of Kingly Government to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or by <hi>Divine Right.</hi> For St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.13. and 14. ſtiles Kings as well as the Governors under him the ordinance of man, which cannot have any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, but that men make them and give them their powers. By St. <hi>Paul</hi> the power of Government indeed is called Gods Ordnance <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. but that is, for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in general God approves of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as neceſſary to the well being of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, for the improvement of humane nature, for the puniſhing of Vice, Encouragement and ſecurity of virtue, without them it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to live honeſtly and in peace. And he hath made them the under Miniſters of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56755:158"/> and care over Mankind, and expects of them, that they ſhould promote his true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Worſhip in the World, which will be always accompanied with the exerciſe of all civil Virtues. Theſe two different places muſt be ſo underſtood, that they may be both true, and by no other interpretation can they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled and made conſiſtent.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible, that any thing can be of mans appointment, which is of Gods Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there can be no ſuch thing, as a Co-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power of Men with their Maker, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment therefore is from God, as he hath made Governments neceſſary in the general or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things, but the ſpecification thereof is from Men, and the beſt definition that can be made of Government is, in the words of both the Apoſtles put together <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and ſuch Governments, which men make God approves and requires our obedience to them upon all thoſe reaſons, which make Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The natural and eaſie conſequence and reſult of theſe Scriptures is this, which I deſire thoſe Gentlemen to obſerve. That whatſoever is not lawfully eſtabliſhed by men, no Law of God not the Chriſtian Law doth oblige us to obey. The Chriſtian Religion doth equally condemn in the reaſon of its Inſtitutions, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation, and Contumacy. Where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle admoniſheth us, that if we be free we ſhould
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56755:158"/> not become ſervants, he hath by virtue of that Admonition, made it commendable not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Encroachments of power over us. Moſt certainly therefore as the Chriſtian Religion doth not prejudice the Soveraign Rights of Princes, ſuch as they are in the ſeveral forms and Modells of Monarchical Governments, <hi>non eripit terreſtria qui regna dat coeleſtia as Sedulius,</hi> ſo doth it not enlarge them; when by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel God made us free from his own poſitive Laws to the <hi>Jews,</hi> he did not intend thereby <hi>de Jure,</hi> to render us ſlaves to the Arbitrary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Men.</p>
            <p>No Man intends by any thing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that all mankind is obliged to any one form of Government, and therefore all Men are left to their own. It hath not therefore alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the terms of Government and Obedience, that every Nation hath Eſtabliſhed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but hath confirmed and ſtrictly obliged the obſervance of them.</p>
            <p>To Obedience, to Government; we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by as many ties as there are Chriſtian Virtues, and he muſt diſown his Chriſtianity, that departs from his due Allegiance. And ſince our Saviour is declared King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, all Kings, Chriſtian Kings eſpecially, are to govern in Imitation of his mercy and goodneſs, and in ſubſerviency to the Intereſt of his Religion and Kingdom.</p>

            <p>Whence then is this abſolute Authority of Kings, if it come neither from God nor Man.</p>
            <p>Give me leave now to inform you, that theſe opinions render you all Traytors, guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State, <hi>perduellionis rei</hi> obnoxious to be puniſhed as Traytors by an Authority lodged in Parliament, In the Conſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>You your ſelves muſt needs condemn your ſelves to have forfeited all your own, who hold ſuch Principles, that tend to deſtroy every Mans Right, by reſolving all things into the abſolute pleaſure of a Monarch, in which you moſtly diſſerve the King, and are contrary to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties late Declaration. The Men of theſe Principles the leſs of the Government, they are entruſted with the better, for the leſs they have to give up and betray. I confeſs, if I could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that this Doctrin was become Orthodox among them, and the prevailing opinion of the Clergy, I ſhould conclude us to be the moſt unhappy people under the Sun. This is an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis indeed, that will bring on <hi>new Heavens and a new Earth,</hi> but ſuch wherein no peace or Righteouſneſs can ever dwell. But I deem all ſuch as are Defenders and Promoters of it, do deſerve a civil Excommunication, more ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then their Eccleſiaſtical, and to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live upon, and only feed themſelves with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56755:159"/> their thin ſpeculations, and to be excluded from any ſhare of that Government, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly in their Principles betray, to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as ſeditious perſons, and moſt miſchievous Schiſmaticks, far more intolerable in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the ſcrupulous brother-hood, for their boglings at an indifferent and inſignificant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. For that to the ruin of our Religion and deſtruction of the publick peace, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide from that polity, to which by drawing here their firſt breath, they made Faith, and to which the condition of their birth doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them, they falſify that which <hi>Arrian</hi> in his <hi>Epictetus</hi> calls the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> than which nothing is more ſacred and inviolable.</p>
            <p>By creating themſelves a new Allegiance, and obtruding it upon their fellow Citizens, and Members of the ſame Kingdom, they ſet up a Kingdom within a Kingdom, more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and miſchievous than the Papal <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in Imperio,</hi> which certainly will be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, if this Modern, and monſtrouſly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant opinion can prevail by a general Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>It is criminal, and no leſs dangerous to the being of any policy to reſtrain the legiſlative Authority, and to entertain Principles, that diſables it to provide remedy againſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſchiefs, that can happen to any Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. No Government can ſupport it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an unlimited Power, in providing for the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56755:160"/> happineſs of the people: No Civil eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but is controlable and alterable to the publick Weale. What ever is not of Divine Inſtitution, ought to yield and ſubmit to this Power and Authority.</p>
            <p>The Succeſſion to the Crown is of a civil nature, not eſtabliſhed by any Divine Right. Several Kingdoms have ſeveral Laws of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, ſome are Elective, others Haereditary under ſeveral Limitations. All humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions are made <hi>tum ſenſu humanae imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> under reaſonable exceptions of unforeſeen accidents and Emergencies, that may happen in humane Affairs, and ſo they muſt be intended and ſo interpreted. The ſeveral limitations of the deſcent of the Crown, muſt be made by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in conferring the Royal Dignitie and power which is more or leſs in ſeveral Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The deſcent of the Crown is governed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſumed will of the People, and the preſumption of the peoples will, is made by meaſuring, and conſidering what is moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the publick good, whereas private Eſtates are directed in their deſcent according to the deſcendents. And this is the reaſon that the deſcent of the Crown is governed by other rules than private Eſtates. Only one daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not all as in private Eſtates, ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Crown, becauſe the ſtrength of the Kingdom is preſerved when continueds united, and the peace and concord of the people better
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56755:160"/> Eſtabliſhed. A ſon of the ſecond venter ſhall inherit, which is not allowed in private Eſtates, becauſe a ſon of the ſecond venter is equally of the blood of the great Anceſtor, upon whom the Crown was firſt conferred by the people, or after he had got into the Throne obtain'd their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, &amp; may equally participate of his Virtues.</p>
            <p>If the Royal Family be extinct, it belongs to the people to make a new King, under what limitations they pleaſe, or to make none; for the Polity is not deſtroyed if there be no King created, and conſequently in caſe of this ceſſer or diſcontinuance of the <hi>Regnum,</hi> there may be Treaſon committed againſt the people. By all which it is evident, that the ſucceſſion to the Crown is the peoples right: And though the ſucceſſion to the Crown is Hereditary, becauſe the people ſo appointed it, would have it ſo, or conſented to have it ſo. Yet in a particular caſe for the ſaving the Nation, the whole line and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy it ſelf, it may be altered by the unlimited Power of the Legiſlative Authority. We have been more juſt to the Royal Succeſſion, than the wonderful Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> for his Hypotheſes will not allow at all of Hereditary rightful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. For the eſtabliſhing the right of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Empire of the World in <hi>Adams</hi> right heir, ſince this illuminato (hath enlightned the world in this ſecret,) no Succeſſor can derive any he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary right from his Predeceſſor. His Title can be only his own poſſeſſion, for no man can
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56755:161"/> claim by deſcent the Uſurpation of his Father, but he that is not conſcious to the wrong, and is <hi>bonae fidei poſſeſſor,</hi> under the preſumed right and title of his Father. I would be underſtood to ſpeak as the matter can be conſidered in a free Reaſon, not under the prejudice of any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive municipal law, for to ſuch laws the right of Crowns, as the Renowned Knight will have it, are not ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>So that here in this matter their Knight fails them, and can give them no help. Their other Friend the great <hi>Leviathan Maker,</hi> is ſo far from eſtabliſhing an Hereditary Succeſſion, that he leaves Kings to be rightfully aſſaulted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and deſtroyed, by any perſon that can, who ſtands in danger of being deſtroyed by the King, though juſtly condemned to death; <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan Part.</hi> 2. Cap. 21. <hi>Thoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that have committed a Capital Crime, for which they expect death, have the liberty to defend themſelves by Arms as well as the Innocent.</hi> But I mention him only to render him deteſtable, for I take his Books to be the <hi>dehoneſtamenta humani ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris.</hi> But I deſire them to regard the ſenſe of all Mankind, in the words of <hi>Iſiodorus Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſiota,</hi>

               </gap>, This Governed the Judicious and Learned Dr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> for when he had carried Chriſtian Loyalty as high as he could, to the honor of our Religion and the benefit of the World for which we are all extreamly beholden
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56755:161"/> to him, he concludes thus in his excellent Book called <hi>Chriſtian Loyalty. That if any Prince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to alienate his Kingdom, or to give it up into the hands of another Sovereign Power, or that really acts the Deſtruction or the Univerſal calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his People,</hi> he tells us <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks <hi>that in his utmoſt extremity, the uſe of a defence, as a laſt refuge</hi> ultimo neceſſitatis preſidio <hi>is not to be condemned, provided the care of the Common good be preſerved.</hi> And <hi>if this be true</hi> ſaith he <hi>it muſt be upon this ground; that ſuch attempts of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> de ipſo facto <hi>include a diſclaiming the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe perſons as Subjects, and conſequently of being their Prince or King;</hi> what unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs is there then in ſhutting the door upon him, and making it faſt againſt him by an act of State, who hath excluded himſelf by his principles and deſigns. For the truth of the fact, I ſhall only refer you to <hi>Secretary</hi> Coleman <hi>his Letters,</hi> wherein he ſaith <hi>that his Maſters inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the King of</hi> France <hi>his intereſt, is one and the ſame, and their deſign their glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the ſame</hi> (viz) <hi>the extirpating the Northern Hereſie,</hi> how far the King of <hi>France</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, with the deſign the cruel Perſecution, and exils of his Proteſtant Subjects, who at the time of that letter, were under the ſecurity and protection of the Laws of that Kingdom, the Faith of that Crown, do declare to the world. And by what ſecret influences I know no, the is made ſo great, his conqueſts ſo eaſie and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56755:162"/> that he is like to do the work himſelf here in <hi>England,</hi> and go away with all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But if the work muſt lye upon our hands, let no man think with himſelf, that Popery is not to be introduced here, becauſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Papiſts are few, for that will not render the deſign impracticable, but the execution of it were cruel and barbarous, a whole Nation upon the matter muſt be corrupted from the Faith of the true Religion or deſtroy'd. One ſingle arm of an ordinary ſtrength not reſiſted, may aſſaſſinate a whole Nation.</p>
            <p>Let no man betray his Country and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by pretending the example of the patience, and ſufferance of the Primitive Chriſtians for our rule.</p>
            <p>The Reformed Religion hath acquired a civil right, and the protection of Laws, if we ought not to looſe our Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates, but where forfeited by Law, we ought much rather not to looſe them for the profeſſion of the beſt Religion, which by Law is made the publick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Religion. And it is ſtrange that ſome men of the ſame Religion in profeſſion can think (that notwithſtanding) it makes no matter what is done to a man, if he be Religious, but if he be not ſo, the leaſt publick injuries and injuſtice may be reſiſted, vindicated, remedyed, and by right defended by old Laws, or new ones, to be made for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Religion was publiſht, when
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56755:162"/> the whole world was Pagan, and therefore it was ſubmitted to ſuch uſage as the Governments would give it. But when the Chriſtian Faith, had by miracles of patience declared it ſelf to be of Heaven, and of a Divine Original: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prophecies on that behalf, it took poſſeſſion of the Empire, and Crowns, and Scepters became ſubmitted to the Croſs, and the Chriſtians acquir'd a civil right of Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Immunity, which they ought not, they cannot relinquiſh and abandon, no more than they can deſtroy themſelves, or ſuffer violence and cruelty to deſtroy the Innocent. Such as thus periſh ſhall never wear a Martyrs Crown, but periſh in the next world for periſhing in this. This will be interpretatively Crucifying Chriſt afreſh, after he is received up into Glory. i. e. After his Religion is exalted into dignity and honor and civil Authority. If the ſenate of <hi>Rome</hi> had been Chriſtians, they would never have given up the Government to a <hi>Pagan Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> with a power to him and his Succeſſors, to make laws for extirpating the Chriſtian Faith, what is ſaid of the Chriſtian Religion, and Paganiſm holds between the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Popery.</p>
            <p>If any man is ſo vain as to ſay, that an unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable courſe of Succeſſion, is eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us by Divine Right. I ſay he is a man fitted to believe tranſubſtantiation, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Pope; he is deeply lapſed into
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56755:163"/> fanaticiſm, he dreams when he is awake, and his dreams are dreams of phrenſie. There are ſomethings ſo falſe, that they cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, as ſomethings are ſo evidently true that they cannot be proved. This propoſition hath no color to ground it ſelf upon, no medium to prove it, no argument for it which is to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, nor nothing more abſurd than it ſelf to reduce it to: But if any ſhall add, that this Doctrin is the Doctrin of the Reformation, and adventure to tell the people ſo, they are the moſt impudent falſaries that ever any age pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, when there is ſcarce a Child, but hath heard what was done, ſaid, and maintained, by the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Mary Queen of</hi> Scots, <hi>a Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> in the earlieſt time of our Reformation here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Age is bleſſed with a Clergy renownedly Learned, and Prudent: by the Providence of God, and the piety of our Anceſtors, they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs good, though not to be envyed Revenues and Honors.</p>
            <p>It is ſcarce poſſible, they ſhould have many among them, that can countenance a propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo wickedly impious and ſacrilegious (that we cannot have new Laws, but muſt looſe the old, at the pleaſure of a Popiſh Succeſſor) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt not their own intereſt, and the Rights of the Church, but againſt the Rights and Liberty of Religion it ſelf. For ſhe is capable of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes and Immunitys: which ought above all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56755:163"/> things to be moſt zealouſly aſſerted and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her Miniſters, can they themſelves with their own hands ever pull down her Hedg and deſtroy her Defenſatives, and expoſe her help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the rage of her implacable Enemies, and ſuſpend all the Legal ſecurity ſhe hath for her preſervation, upon the Life of our preſent King, whom God long preſerve. If Kings be admitted to have a power to make Laws. One Proclamation may eſtabliſh the Popiſh Religion amongſt us, which the Papal Bulls ſo long as that See continues, will never be able to effect. Next to Religion her ſelf, the Revenues of the Church challenge their faithful care, for they are at beſt but Uſu-fructuary Truſtees of her Endowments for the Succeſſion, which they will wretchedly betray to an Arbitrary Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, if they do not repreſs ſuch Opinions that pretend to change the Government, into an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>jure Divinity Monarchy,</hi> which will leave nothing <hi>jure divino</hi> but it ſelf and the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Kings for their ſo doing have the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> who affirms in his Treatiſe called the <hi>Power of Kings,</hi> Fol. 1. <hi>That the Laws, Ordinances, Letters, Patents, Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Grants of Princes have no force but during their Life, if they be not ratified by the expreſs conſent, or at leaſt by the ſufferance of the Prince following, who had a knowledge thereof.</hi> This is but the neceſſary conſequence and reſult from the Doctrine of the abſolute power of a Prince,
<pb facs="tcp:56755:164"/> for in ſuch Government the Conceſſions of a Predeceſſor can no more oblige the Succeſſor, than he can Govern when he is dead; and the Succeſſor muſt be abſolute in his time, as the Predeceſſors were in theirs. But in vain is the Net ſpread, in the ſight of any Bird; this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is of ſo groſs a thread, that it cannot paſs with the common people, much leſs upon our Clergy; but I will not diſſemble what may be the true reaſon of the ſeduction of ſome young good natured Gentlemen of the Clergy: They perſwade themſelves that if theſe principles and opinions of the <hi>Unlimited Power of Kings</hi> had been received, the late Wars had been prevented: Not rightly conſidering, that if ſuch opinions had never been broached, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally rejected, that War could never have enſued; and we ſhould together with peace have enjoyed our ancient Government, which our Anceſtors tranſmitted to us, without that miſerable <hi>inter-regnum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not be perverſely underſtood by any man, as if I went about to juſtify our late War: This is all I ſay, that every Government once eſtabliſhed will continue for ever, if all the parts of it would unalterably conſent to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, to which their narural Allegiance doth oblige them: And never any Prince endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to change the Government, but where part of the people were firſt willing, or content to have it ſo.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:56755:164"/>
            <p>Thoſe falſe flatterers that go about to remove the boundaries of power, and change the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are the greateſt enemies to the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and happy Reigns of the Kings, and the peace and proſperity of Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And if they do adventure to call the;ir fellow Subjects, by any opprobrious names of diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, becauſe they will not joyn with them in ſuch change, they are as abſurdly impious and inſolent, as any Prince or State would be, who ſhould challenge another, as free and abſolute as himſelf, for his Tributary and Vaſſal; and traduce him for a troubler of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not Compoſe the Quarrel, thus injuriouſly ſought, with the ſurrender of his Crown and dignity.</p>
            <p>I deſire theſe Gentlemen to conſider, that the happineſs of a Nation, is beſt ſupported with Truth and Juſtice: This new Doctrine is not true, and whoſoever entertains a belief of it, is not only barely miſtaken, but will be lead by the miſtake, into the moſt miſchievous, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſacrilegious injuſtice, and treachery.</p>
            <p>It is very agreeable to a good man, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a propoſition, with an eaſie belief that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the leaſt ſeeming probability of a ſecurity againſt the miſeries of War, by all means to be avoided. But this Doctrine of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Kings, is moſt dangerous to the Peace of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, for it is pregnant with Wars: Beſides that it will give bad Princes, which ſometime
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56755:165"/> hereafter may be Born into the World, (for ſuch there have been now and then) power to make their Reigns worſe then War, and Plague, and Famine to boot.</p>
            <p>The Panick fear of a change of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that this Doctrine occaſioned, and the Diviſions it made among us, was the principal cauſe of the late War.</p>
            <p>It is not without reaſon, that together with theſe new principles, revived ſince the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Popiſh Plot, we have a perpetual din and noiſe of <hi>Forty one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then that fatal War begun, which ended in the deſtruction of the Prince, and ruine of the Church and State; The remembrance of it is the principal matter, that ſtuffs our weekly Pamphlets, and it is brought into common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and grown ſo trivial, that it is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and heard without abhorrence and regret: And what Service this can be to His Majeſty, I do not underſtand; much better it were, that the memory of it were utterly extinct and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for ever, except only in the Anniverſary of that great Prince, that ſo fell. Then I ſay, and then only is it fit to be remembred, when we are on our Knees to God Almighty, and in his preſence affecting our ſelves, with ſorrow and remorſe, deprecating the like Judgments, and bewailing the National ſins, that occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe; For notwithſtanding the Glories of that Great Prince his unhappy death, and the

            <p>How then can this tend to the peace of the Nation, or the Honor of the King? what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is it to have our almoſt healed wounds, thus perpetually rub'd and kept green?</p>

            <p>Why ſhould any of our Nation, inſult over the miſeries of his own, and neighbour King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, when he muſt be the moſt barbarous villain, and have deveſted himſelf of all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that is not deeply empaſſioned at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membranee of them? If a <hi>Thuanus,</hi> or a <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> were to paſs a Judgment, of the condition of our late times; upon the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our late Tragedies, and the Preludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um's to it in the Reigns of King <hi>James</hi> and the late King, it would be formed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56755:166"/> in theſe words of <hi>Tully,</hi> upon another occaſion: <q>Mihi quidem, ſi proprium &amp; verum nomen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri mali quaeratur, fatalis quaedam calamitas inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſe videtur, &amp; improvidas hominum mentes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupaviſſe, ut nemo mirari debeat humana conſilia divina neceſſitate eſſe ſuperata.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all,
<q>—nec adhuc finitur Oreſtes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We are affrighted by the weekly Pamphlets, with the expectation of another Parliamentary War, and this is the true reaſon of the mention of the late War, that we may forgo our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for fear of another. So it is written in our publick prints, which are publiſhed under permiſſion, as if Parliaments are deſigned to be rendered hateful, and to be feared as Plagues, Famines, or Inundations of the Sea.</p>
            <p>But who is to begin it, who deſigns this War, the Pamphlateers, or thoſe that ſet them on work, beſt know: We had never heard of any ſuch thing, if the Mercenary writers of the Popiſh Faction had not told us of it, as they do weekly, and hitherto we cannot find any Colour for this affrightful Lye; they are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſo to talk of it, as if they believed it, and have brought ſome as weak men as they are falſe Knaves to a belief of it: But to do them no wrong, thoſe may beſt know what is to come
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56755:166"/> to paſs, who have the power of contriving and deſigning.</p>
            <q>Qui pavet vanos metus veros fatetur.</q>
            <p>The vileſt Traitors cannot contrive a greater prejudice to the King and his Family, than by advancing ſuch a diſmal thing into credit and belief, for fears though but upon imaginary and falſe grounds, produce real effects, as well as they are in themſelves really afflictive, and that almoſt equally, if of continuance to the evils feared. Do theſe men ſpeak like true Loyaliſts, that are mentioning perpetually the Calamitous War, in the time of our Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fright us with another now enſuing? after thoſe Univerſal, Solemn and hearty Joys of the whole Nation for his Reſtauration, after ſo many Millions of Money, moſt dutifully iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the affections of his people, from time to time at His Majeſties Royal pleaſure, and nothing complain'd of, but that they have not opportunities of iſſuing ten times more, to the ſervice of His Majeſties Glory. Nay they ſpeak of this enſuing War, as if the Royal Standard was already diſplayed, and the Rebels had made their Muſters; which muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect the Royal Family with the greateſt danger.</p>
            <p>If there were twenty <hi>Trajans</hi> derived from one ſtock, that had Reigned in an uninterrupted Succeſſion, Two immediate Succeſſors, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56755:167"/> ſhould have their Reigns ſucceſsively attended with civil Wars, were enough to efface their own, and the glories and merits of ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors: But baſe Caitiffs, you can no more truly believe the laſt Parliaments deſigned upon His Majeſties Crown and Dignity to make War, and change the Government, than you can believe that every Mothers Child of them, before they came up to the laſt Parliaments, ſet his Houſe on fire, and burnt his Wife and Children.</p>
            <p>But theſe impudent Forgeries againſt the Houſe of Commons, are contrived to make the people afraid of Parliaments, that this new model of Government in proceſs of time, when we have an enterpriſing Succeſſor, may take place, for the ſervice of the Popiſh Religion. For upon the ſtrength of Dr. <hi>B—s</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, who hath with great labor found out (which it is hard for any man acquainted with our Engliſh Hiſtory to be ignorant of) that our Parliaments were not always ſuch as now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted: this bleſſed change of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will never be atchieved, the Nation will never be perſwaded, by any thing that he hath found out in his diligent reſearch, that the Houſe of Commons is an <hi>over-grown Wen,</hi> an unnatural Accreſcency to the Government, and fit to be cut off. Neither can the moſt inſolent Paradox of Sir <hi>Robert Filmers Patriarcha,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much to this purpoſe. But that it may
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56755:167"/> be able to deceive but a very few, for the time to come; for the ſake of ſuch Gentlemen who have not Choſen their ſide, are glad of the leaſt Color, or dream of a Shadow, a ſingle opinion of any body, it matters not whom to relieve their modeſty, in their notorious defections from Truth, Juſtice and the Government. I ſhall here conſider his Hypotheſis, eſpecially for that it was Re-printed, and is magnified by the <hi>Factors</hi> for the Popiſh Plot.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I will draw it out ſhortly, in all its ſtrength, and make it more argumentative than he hath left it, (for he hath left his will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readers to find out the Argument, and to make the Concluſion) Adam ſaith he, <hi>was the Father of Mankind, that to him as Father, belonged an Abſolute dominion over all his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendents; that all Men being ſo born, are born under ſubjection to ſuch an Authority: This au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo reſerved upon us by God, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our birth, and the manner of coming into the World, is to be ſubmitted to, in the perſon of the preſent King, who by becoming King, is for that reaſon veſted with this abſolute Authority. This power and the duty of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it, reſults from our being Born, and coming into the World, after the manner of men.</hi> This power of Kings is grounded (by him) meerly upon this natural reſultance, and not from any poſitive and expreſs Revelation from God, for ſuch, neither we, nor, he yet ever
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56755:168"/> heard of. We will now then conſider, what there is of weight in this fictitious Reaſon of Government, in which the World is ſo lately illuminated by this Speculator; what force there is in it to unravel all Models of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that are framed in the World, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Kingdoms and Nations, and to give Warranty to the bringing upon us, all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries that are deſigned by the Papiſts for us, which we are to be prepared to ſuffer, with moſt conſcientious patience, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and ſupports of this inſolent and vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>I appeal to the Reader of him, whither in thus ſtating his Doctrine, I have not made it more Argumentative, and concluding to his purpoſe than he left it: I will take this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of remonſtrating the fertility of his <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By conſidering what a Father is, and what his Duty towards, and Power over his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in which it will be found, that nothing of Empire belongs to him as Father, that no more belonged to <hi>Adam</hi> over his Children, than did to any of his Children over their own.</p>
            <p>That the Authority of Parents over their Children, continues together with Soveraign power, and is not at all abated by it, and that it cannot be the ſame, becauſe it continues entire with it.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56755:168"/>
            <p>That there is no footſteps in the Records of the Old Teſtament, to verify his <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> that we could not have wanted ſome Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about it from God, (if true) it being a matter ſo neceſſary for us to know, That no claims were made, (that we know of) to any ſuch authority in the earlieſt times, when the Right was unprejudiced, and muſt have been beſt underſtood, and could not have been forgotten, as now it is utterly.</p>
            <p>Beſides that it was never uſed. The firſt Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Recorded in the Bible, makes every Child of the common Anceſtor, alike independent and abſolute, and ſo it would for ever have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued: And to this day we ſhould have been in the ſtate of Nature, and not United in any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſo no King yet in the World, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Paternal authority. That his Inſtances of exerciſing Soveraign power by the Fathers of Families, are not concluding, and to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>That admitting <hi>Adam</hi> had while he liv'd been Univerſal Monarch, (yet if there be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon and Foundation of Monarchy in the World, but this of Sir <hi>Robert Filmer) A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> right heir not been known, (and if he were might perhaps be an Ideot or Lunatick, ſome Cobler or Botcher under a Stall, or mean Perſon unfit to govern) we can have no right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King in the World, for certain it is, that there is nothing in the World ſo perſonal as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56755:169"/> Relations, and the duties and Rights that do reſult from them: for they are neither aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to, nor can be exerciſed or exacted by and between any perſons, but the Relatives them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: So that this power of Sir <hi>R. F.</hi> hath no foundation of reaſon in the nature of things, was in Fact never exerciſed, and is now utterly fallen to the ground, and all Government with it. A more puſled, vain, ſenſleſs and unlearned Paradox, was never yet offer'd to the World, nor a thing more miſchievous ever received.</p>
            <p>The abſolute Power of a Prince over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is not at all connatural to the dutiful Care of a Father over his Children.</p>
            <p>It was the good pleaſure of God that this part of the immenſe world, ſhould be planted with men endowed with a capacity to admire his power, wiſdom and goodneſs, and therefore to render him praiſe and worſhip: he deſign'd that we ſhould be happy in our own enjoyments, and promote the happineſs of each other, which is not to be performed but by a mind ſerene, beneficent and loving. He provided that the diſſeminations of Love ſhould run parallel, and be under a like neceſſity with the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of our kind. For the planting love in our nature, he inſtituted Marriage for Procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we might owe our Being to the ſtate of the greateſt and moſt agreeable friendſhip, and tendereſt affection. That for many years we ſhould be educated by a pure ſingle and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56755:169"/> undeſigning love of our Parents: and the friendſhip of that conjugal State, ſhould be maintained by, and principally exerciſed in, their common care of their iſſue.</p>
            <p>Every Act of Love, of either of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to the Child, being the beſt inſtance of love to the other of them; an endearment of a reciprocal love, and a provocation to the like love and care of the Child. God did likewiſe ordain and ſo it was, that all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould derive from one ſtock, be made of one blood, and every Man, every Mans Brother of the ſame family and cognation. By this it was provided by the Father of us all, that we ſhould be born into the World, under the tendreſt care for our preſervation and improvement of our Nature, and be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully enclined to love, and beneficence, whereby we may be pleaſed with our ſelves, and at Peace and Amity with our whole kind.</p>
            <p>That the Generations of Mankind might certainly proceed, God planted in our Natures powerful and irreſiſtible inſtincts to procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the <hi>Jews</hi> call a Precept, tho after this no Precept ſeem'd neceſſary, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply they make a Command. But we follow our own propenſions and have no conſcience of obedience to a Law, when we obſerve and follow them, which are ſo ſtrong pleaſurable and entertaining, that if God had not planted a reſtraint of Modeſty in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56755:170"/> our Natures, and a ſenſe of decency. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſelves from the dignity of our Natures.</p>
            <p>Thus far the Parents are fulfilling Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments and gratifying their own Natures. What from all this can give them a right over their Child, all men coming into the world this way are no leſs free, then if they had been form'd in <hi>Lucretius</hi> his Bottles, and drop't out of his imaginary matrixes, and we were all <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> &amp; Aborigines.</p>
            <p>In this they are only executing the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, are but his Inſtruments to bring us into this World, and are all along reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and entertained and careſſed by the order of Nature. <hi>Adam</hi> ow'd this duty to God his Father, and ſo ordered it was, that he ow'd it to himſelf, and to his own natural propenſions, pleaſures and ſatisfactions to propagate. The ſeveral ſucceeding generations of men, as ſoon as they are men have as much Right to the enjoyment of themſelves to the freedom of their own Will, and to live by their own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf had. Our Parents do not give us life, but hand it to us from the Fountain of being the Univerſal Father of all things.</p>
            <q>Vitai Lampadu tradunt.</q>
            <p>And this is allowed, acknowledged by all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56755:170"/> Mankind, for aſſoon as Children can Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves, we declare them free that they are <hi>ſui juris</hi> they are extrafamiliated and become themſelves Fathers and acquire to themſelves.</p>
            <p>But that which hath impoſed upon this, Gentleman, I believe is, for that while they are to be educated, their Parents exerciſe an Authority over their Children which a ſouer Father may imagine to be power. This I believe gave the Gentleman his maſtake, becauſe he ſaith a Child and a Slave, doth not differ which is a ſhrewd indication that he was ſomething too maſterly over his Children. But all equal parents know and underſtand that the Education of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is duty and care, and may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly be called, a Sort of Generation Work.</p>
            <p>For I pray let it be conſidered, that the foetus is not perfected aſſoon as it is extru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Matrix, no not until it be able to perform, unaſsiſted all the Actions of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per life. That the life of a man is a life of Reaſon, that he cannot do the Acts of a man, until he hath it in the exerciſe of it. He is not a perfect foetus ſo as to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by his parents, as ſoon as he can feed himſelf the man after this may miſcarry, and if expoſed by his parents, and not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under their care be abortivated. Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56755:171"/> is a kind of Incubation. Our faculties are to be formed and drawn out into uſe, as well as our body, to be organized, before we can be denominated men, and while this is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>compliſhing the parents are but executing the natural inſtinct of propagating their like, until they have made them men, they are not begotten in their own likeneſs. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with an eaſie propenſion, and a natural care do apply themſelves to offer things to their obſervation, to furniſh their Memories, to try their judgments in little Eſſays, to render them diſcourſive to draw out their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties into uſe, until by little and little they arrive at diſcretion, and a power to form true judgments of what belongs to them, and to govern themſelves in ſuch Affairs and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, that are to employ them.</p>
            <p>But while this is a doing, they are under a Government of love and care, by the Arts of Diſcipline to be trained up to perfection. Several freakiſhneſſes and caprices are to be cured, and the ſtrength and luxuriancies of ſeveral natural Appetites, are to be abated and reſtrained; and they are to be held to attention and obſervation, and made patient of inſtruction, and correction is to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to theſe purpoſes, and by theſe meaſures, but this duty of Correction doth not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate any thing of the Nature of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It hath nothing of the Nature of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56755:171"/> puniſhment exemplarity or vindicative Juſtice</p>
            <p>It is not for the gratifying of the Parents diſpleaſure to ſecure him againſt wrong or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to deter others, but to amend improve and better the Child, and always terminated to, and directed to that end, and by thoſe meaſures it is tenderly and affectionately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred. It will not be impertinent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that our Common Law, had no opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Soveraign Authority in a Father.</p>
            <p>And alſo that the Statute of 25 E. 3. which declares petty Treaſons as well as high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doth not declare, the ſons killing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Treaſon, tho Treaſon it is, for a Servant to Kill his Maſter: In which we have the Authority of our Parliament, and of the conſtant opinion of our Judges. That the nature and relation of a Father and a Son, doth not ſavor any thing of Government, or of a ſervile or Political ſubjection. For that they have not made parricide Treaſon tho it is the moſt unnatural and moſt deteſtable Crime, and a far greater ſin than that of Killing a Maſter.</p>
            <p>But further to clear the true notion of a Fathers Authority, that it is duty and care, not Empire and abſolute will. Let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that God by his right of Creation, hath an abſolute dominion over us; we are more his than we are our own, or than any thing can be ours. Yet when he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of his gracious condeſcention to our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56755:172"/> to quiet our fears of his power, and to invite our love and aſſure our hope, he did declare himſelf our Father thereby to aſſure us, that he would not rule us <hi>pro imperio,</hi> and according to his abſolute right he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, that ſtile he himſelf delights to uſe, and give us leave to call him our Father, by which we all underſtand, that he will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with us according to his Right of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute domination, no not in the terms of Right and Political Juſtice. But that he will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our frame, pity our infirmity, correct us as his Children, but not puniſh us with an exterminating Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> antiently no man was admitted a Judge in criminal Cauſes, but he that was a Father of Children, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of a Judge might be abated by the tenderneſs of a Father, that he who had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his own, might have the more pity to thoſe of others, ſo different is the office of a Judge from the natural duty and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Father. And it is the greateſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that can be done to nature, to compel a Father to ſit in Judgment upon his Son, and next to that of obliging and compelling a man to execute himſelf, to make it the Fathers duty to pronounce a capital ſentence upon the Son, is the moſt unnatural thing in the world, the Father and the Son in this conſideration are <hi>conjunctae perſonae,</hi> and when the Sin of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56755:172"/> Father is viſited upon the ſon, the ſon is afflicted, but the Father is puniſhed, and when the Son hath the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> the Father is taken to be confeſſed <hi>in tormentis filii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for a further inſtance to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, how imcompetent the duty of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is with the Nature of a Father, I will obſerve that notwithſtanding a Law was given to <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Sons, to eſtabliſh judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures according to the Tradition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as may be ſeen in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> his Book <hi>de jure Gentium ſecundum Hebraeos,</hi> which Law by the way had been ſupervacaneous, if the Power of a Prince did belong to <hi>Adam</hi> in the right of his paternity, and a Government had been provided for them by their Birth. Yet I ſay notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that: There was ſuch a Relaxation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the World before the Flood, becauſe it could be only adminiſtred by a Father, or ſuch who participated of the ſtock of love lodg'd in the common Father, from whom his Children did derive their tenderneſs, one to another, as they themſelves ſprang from him. That the World was grown ſo wicked with in 2 ages (as men then liv'd) from the creation, that a Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal deluge was brought upon the World, by the Juſt Judgment of God, for the outragious &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable Wickedneſs, that had ſpread it ſelf u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally over mankind; 8 Perſons only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The overflowing deluge of Wickedneſs, that caus'd the deluge of waters can't be imputed, to a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56755:173"/> more probable cauſe than to the indulgence and impunity, that the obſerved and underſtood nearneſs of Kindred, that all men ſtood then in to one another muſt naturally occaſion.</p>
            <p>This is a ſad conſequence of that natural Love in Parents towards their Children, which was intended for the propagation and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mankind. But ſince that now we are eſtranged one from another in remote, and unknown degrees, &amp; that prejudice is over. Here is a gentleman to deſtroy the World another way, and to undo us by unreaſonable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded power, which is a like apt to make the World fit for another Univerſal deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if it be not without more deſtroyed by it; doth endeavor to turn the exerciſe of ſuch power into a Right, and to give it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty from the Reaſon and way of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, and by this means to deſtroy us fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, then we can be born and bred, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Generations of Mankind, or render them extreamly miſerable, or wicked which is much worſe, extinguiſh the light of the world, which is Love and Amity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the encouragement and reaſon of almoſt all relative Morality.</p>
            <p>What a Saturnine Father have we got, to make a golden Age, who ever would have thought, that the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But this Gentlemen will not allow Nature to be good in her firſt inſtitution and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho in this I think they are near agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> made the Pourtraiture of Humane Nature in an agreeableneſs to his own evil Ingeny. And this Knight did ſet himſelf, when he made this his draught of a <hi>Father</hi> he could have no other Original but himſelf, or the Idea of the moroſs and ſower Dr. <hi>P.H.</hi> his admired friend but by his Character he had at leaſt misfigured his underſtanding, and made it his own Nature by liking it.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly, No more of authority belong'd to <hi>Adam</hi> over his Children, then does to any of his Children over his, for that this Authority pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Nature, and Nature is a like in all men, the duty of their education, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them, that is competent to that purpoſe, is as much incumbent upon them, as upon the Protoplaſt, the duty is ſo perſonal conſiſting <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that it cannot be transferred, or permitted abſolutely to any other perſon by the Parents, nor can any man challenge a right to it, or diſcharge the Father from it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſame affection, ſubmiſſion and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that is due from a Child to his Father.</p>
            <p>To expect relative duties without Relation
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56755:174"/> is moſt unnatural, it is as impoſſible as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, and we may as well love and hate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and grieve without the proper objects and incitements of thoſe paſſions. The fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Rule of all morality, is that of <hi>Simplicius</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is as certain as any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in Euclid, as the Doctrin of proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able triangles, and received as ſuch by all the Maſters of Moral Philoſophy, there is no other foundation of our duty to God or Man, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves this rule muſt declare it, and what ever is meaſured and allowed by this Rule, is commonly called, which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of all that is honeſt, juſt, and fit, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the application of this rule is called by St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which when a man obſerves he is perfectly moral, a man may as well pay his debts by giving away his Money, be grateful to his benefactor by being benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to Strangers, as perform that duty he ows his Father to any but he that is ſo: It is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible to ſeparate the ſhadow from the Subſtance as to make that ſubſiſt by it ſelf which grows by reſultance from the ſtate and condition of the perſon. Or that without that ſtate of the perſon, from which it doth ariſe it ſhould ever accrew.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. Admitting <hi>Adam</hi> had a Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all his deſcendents, which muſt grow (if there was any ſuch thing) from ſome poſitive inſtitution, and not from his paternity,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56755:175"/> yet the natural Authority and duty of Parents towards their Children, continues entire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Sovereign Power, and is not at all abated by it, and therefore cannot be the ſame. No Soveraign Power can extort the Children from their Fathers Authority and care: This is a duty in Nature before Governments. They cannot belong to the Government before they are <hi>filii precepti,</hi> and capable of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Law. It is a duty in Parents to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducate their Children, and a right they have in conſequence to govern them, that cannot be taken from them. It is the Parents duty to form their conſciences. They are appoint-by God, the great Miniſters of his Providence to the Children. That they perform this Office, he hath tyed them to it by the ſweateſt conſtraints and almoſt violences of Nature, by an irreſiſtable love and tyes of Endearment, that cannot be broken, this declares their Right of Authority over their Children, againſt any interpoſings of Soveraign Authority to its prejudice, let or hindrance. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> poſitively determines, that it is not lawful for Chriſtian Kings to baptize the Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt the will of their Parents, for that (ſaith he) it is againſt the courſe of natural juſtice.</p>
            <p n="4">4ly, There is no footſteps in the Records of the old World to verifie this Hypotheſis. That ſuch Authority was ſo much as pretended to be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56755:175"/> uſed or exerciſed by <hi>Adam,</hi> but we find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances againſt it in the ſhort Hiſtory before the Flood. <hi>Cain</hi> received no ſentence from <hi>Adam</hi> his Prince and Soveraign Judg, but from God himſelf, or rather from his <hi>Shecinah</hi> or ſome viſible Repreſentation of his preſence.</p>
            <p>Thence he obtained ſome degree of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and his life protected. No mention here at all of <hi>Adam,</hi> his taking the Tribunal or Cains arraignment, or of any pardon or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence granted by King <hi>Adam. Lamech</hi> that had Kill'd a man by miſchance, did not alledge his caſe at his Father <hi>Adams</hi> Court, and the matter of extenuation of the Man-killing, we hear of no pardon of Courſe to be allowed, when the circumſtances of fact had been firſt judicially conſidered.</p>
            <p>How could a thing of ſuch importance be omitted in the ſtory of the old World, tho ſo ſhort. It was of more concernment, than to know that <hi>Tubal Cain</hi> was the firſt Smith and Jubal, the firſt man that made a Muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to know the original nature and reaſon of Government.</p>
            <p>Beſides we find all the grand Children of <hi>Noah,</hi> becoming Princes of Countries, and the Sons and grand ſons of <hi>Eſau</hi> alike Dukes and Princes, that is at leaſt abſolute Fathers of their own Families, and ruling over ſuch as were their ſlaves and dependents.</p>
            <p>And the 12 Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> are all called Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs:</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56755:176"/>
            <p>When <hi>Nimrod</hi> played the Tyrant we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid for his juſtification upon any Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal right.</p>
            <p>But if we conſult the Traditions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they will inform us of another original of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that is this. They ſay that God gave ſeveral Precepts to <hi>Adam</hi> and his Sons, and <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, and one amongſt the reſt, that they ſhould erect Governments, which his Sons could not have performed without Rebellion againſt their King Father, if <hi>Adam</hi> had been ſo as Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> firſt dreamt.</p>
            <p>Alſo beſides that of making Governments, there was a Precept given them of honoring their Parents, <hi>Selden de jure Naturae ſecundum Hebraeos fol.</hi> 2792. And therefore the Precept of honoring Parents, is a diſtinct duty from that of obedience to Governments. By this Precept they had Authority in general, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh Governments amongſt themſelves, in the ſpecification of which they were left to rheir own liberty and diſcretion, and therefore were not obliged to any ſingle form of Government. It muſt be underſtood, that the Precept which required the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Governments, required alſo every mans Submiſſion to their Orders, Laws, and Decrees, when eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We will conſider of the inſtances he gives of the Exerciſe of Soveraign Power, by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56755:176"/> Fathers of Families, which are as impertinent to his purpoſe, as his Doctrine is groundleſs and precarious, but they are theſe. <hi>Abrahams</hi> War and <hi>Judahs</hi> judgment upon <hi>Thamar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt of <hi>Abrahams</hi> making War: We ſay we cannot allow, that making War doth argue any Soveraign Authority. It is ſufficient, that he who makes it is under none to make a vindicative War Lawful. For an injured Perſon may in the State of Nature, vindicate wrongs by an authority derived from God and Nature to a juſt ſatisfaction: Becauſe there is no competent judicature to appeal to for right and redreſs. But ſee how unhappy the Gentleman is. This very inſtance of his production is clearly againſt him, for if Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power had been Patriarchal, <hi>Abraham</hi> had been guilty of Treaſon, in making War without a Commiſſion from <hi>Melchizedech</hi> the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> who as the Learned men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, was <hi>Shem</hi> his Patriarch and Chief and known by him for ſuch. But becauſe <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the beſt man perhaps in any Age did not take a Commiſſion from <hi>Melchizedech</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal chief. And yet he was bleſſed by <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedech</hi> when he returned from the War. We may conclude that neither <hi>Melchizedeeh</hi> nor <hi>Abraham</hi> knew of any ſuch Patriarchal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. And alſo from this great example it appears, that it is lawful for him, that is not a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56755:177"/> Soveraign, if he be not under any to make War.</p>
            <p>I will not enter into a diſcourſe, whence and how is derived the Authority of making War and capital Sentences, which muſt have the ſame reaſon to warrant both which hath puſled ſome great Divines. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> that great man was at a loſs in this enquiry, and thinks that nothing but a Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can warrant them, which hath put them upon ſtrange extravagant Hypotheſes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſent this Knights brains a Wool-gathering. But this may ſatisfie any man of ſenſe, that whatever is neceſſary for the general happineſs of mankind, and for preſerving peace in the world, and protecting the innocent, and diſinabling the mighty op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors is more commendable to be done, then the Killing a man in his own defence is ſimply lawful.</p>
            <p>As to his ſecond inſtance of <hi>Judah,</hi> his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced upon his Daughter in Law <hi>Thamar,</hi> which he would have an exerciſe of Patriarchal Soveraign Authority. We ſay how could <hi>Judah</hi> do this by a Patriarchal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when <hi>Jacob</hi> his Father was then alive, and for all that appears <hi>Judah</hi> his Son was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trafamiliated. Beſides which is very unlucky, <hi>Thamar</hi> was then none of his Family, or of the Subjects of his Domeſtick Empire, for his Son her Husband being dead, ſhe was free
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56755:177"/> from the Law of her Husband, and ceaſed to be a Subject of his Paternal Kingdom. But Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> under the Authority of ſome Rabbins, which he cites in his excellent Book before mentioned Fol. 807. ſaith that, <hi>Judah</hi> might have the Office of a Prince or Magiſtrate in a diſtrict in that Country, and by that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might judge her according to the Laws of that Country. But what the Law was, and the Nature and reaſon of her offence, by which it became capital, is not underſtood as he tells us in the place before cited, I ſhall not trouble the Reader with unfolding the matter.</p>
            <p>But why doth he trouble himſelf to make Kings, Fathers of their Countries, ſome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo and ſome have no mind to be ſo, and yet they ought to be Kings. And ſome that have not been Kings, have been ſo and ſo ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as the great M. <hi>Tully,</hi> for defeating the Catiline Conſpiracy, He was by decree of the Senate call'd <hi>Pater Patriae.</hi> Thoſe are with reaſon truly called <hi>Patres patriae,</hi> which either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Country from miſerable preſſures, which is the civil death of a Nation, and for this reaſon our King hath the honor of being called <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and we hope, that he will wear that honorable Title upon a ſecond deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of us from a moſt deplorable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Or elſe ſuch who bring the Nation to an exalted ſtate of happineſs, ſo much beyond their old ſtate of things, that they ſeem to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56755:178"/> give the Nation a new civil Life, Being and Birth. For his etymological argument from the notation of the Word, it is too putid to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, tho not more ridiculous than his <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for that the reduction of our duty to our King, to the fifth Commandment, may ſeem to give ſome advantage to the Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis with Fathers who know no bounds of their power over their Children. It muſt be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Decalogue is not a compleat Rule of Morality. The decalogue compriſed the Principal Laws of that common Wealth, which God their Law giver by a moſt Solemn Act of his Legiſlation, did more awfully oblige them to obſerve.</p>
            <p>God that time was their King, Rebellion was as Idolatry, and the ſin of Witchcraft and the Defection of one of their Cities to Idolatry, was puniſhed as a revolt and Rebellion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. v. 15. He had provided for his honor and worſhip, and their Allegiance in the firſt Table, and did deſign by the 5th Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lay the Foundation of all poſitive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, by providing for a Reciprocation of kindneſſes, by injoyning the gratitude and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting returns of Children to their Parents, and by putting Children under obligations to be taught and inſtructed by their Parents. But our duty to Governors is more duly referred to all the other Commandments, becauſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56755:178"/> ſecures the obſervation of thoſe Laws to us, by which we enjoy our ſelves, and ours freed from the Violations of Luſt, Appetite, Fraud and Violence.</p>
            <p>We do not honor our King by relief in his fortune, which is commanded to be done by our Parents in the precept of honoring them, our ſubſidies and Aids are not to that purpoſe, but contributions to the charges of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are the juſt price of our immunity &amp; protection, from fraud and violence for which cauſe pay we tribute.</p>
            <p>But whoſoever he be, that hath more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for this Knights works then I have, may find him more gently treated by a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman, in a very candid and judicious book called <hi>Patriarcha non Monarcha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is the meaning of theſe flattering Books, they cannot but be nauſeous to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who is a very wiſe Prince, and knows how ſenſleſs ſuch Books are, and beſides they make the People afraid, and the Nation unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et from the apprehenſions they give, that the Government will be changed. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King hath given ſuch ſolemn aſſurance to the Nation by his late Declaration, that we ſhall have frequent Parliaments, and that he will govern by Law.</p>
            <p>They would have had a better market, for the Divinity they beſtow upon Princes, with <hi>Alexander</hi> after he had loſt his Virtue, and with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56755:179"/> thoſe Vile Emperors whoſe Names are <hi>Regum opprobria,</hi> for ſuch the flatterers of antient times Deifyed, thoſe who had ceas'd to be men they made Gods, and when they had left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about them that was tolerable, they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified their power, which was already moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.</p>
            <p>If the Kings hereafter would but read the Hiſtory of Kings, under that concluſion, that a wiſe obſerver of Humane Events made after a long obſervation and experience, and would make experiments of the truth of it in their own reading, Kings would be glorious, and the Nations they govern happy and full of peace.</p>
            <p>They would find therein ſo many effectual Documents to fear God and regard men, and govern them righteouſly.</p>

            <p>People can be no happyer than Government and Laws deſign to make them, though they do not alwayes anſwer the good deſignments of the Government.</p>
            <p>To what purpoſe then are theſe new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56755:179"/> fram'd and publiſhed, Kings are exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by their Office, and the ſacredneſs of their perſons from all fears, but the fears of Nature, and theſe can never be diſcharg'd. Thoſe who do ill will fear ill Eternally, tho their power were made little leſs than omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for the frame of Humane Nature hath made it neceſſary to be ſo. Beſides God hath made one thing againſt another, there is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nemeſis interwoven in the Nature of things, and God will always govern the World.</p>
            <q>Omne ſub regno duriore regnum.</q>
            <p>The great Mogul at his inauguration ſwears, that his People ſhall be at peace at home, and victorious abroad, afflicted neither with plague nor famine, but enjoy Health and Plenty all his days.</p>
            <p>This ſeems extraordinary Pompous and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, but it means no more than this, that he will govern them ſo vertuouſly, that Gods Providence ſhall be always propitious to his People, and is no more in plain Engliſh, than what our Church offers up in her publick prayers for the King. <hi>(viz.)</hi> That he may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us in Wealth Peace and Godlineſs, that he may live long and ſo govern us ought to be every honeſt mans Prayers. But after all theſe vain Hypotheſes contriv'd, for making Kings
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56755:180"/> abſolute, it will be more eaſie for Kings to make their reigns unquiet, and turn their Kingdoms into Shambles.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, to revive the Antient Zeal of the true members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt Popery. To rectify the miſtakes of ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Clergy about the Diſſenters: And of our late Parliaments, and their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in reference to them.</p>
            <p>Let it be conſidered; how unreaſonable their apprehenſions are of any danger to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the deſires of the Houſe of Commons, of ſome indulgence or toleration in favor of the Diſſenters at this time; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the Proteſtant Religion is ſo ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſet, ſhe hath reaſon now ſure to take all ſuch for her friends, that are heartily Enemies to Popery, tho not ſo skillful as they ſhould be to ward off its aſſaults. Since the Papiſts preſume to call them Fanaticks, tho exactly conformable to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that will not aſſiſt to bring on the Popiſh Plot by disbelieving it; and put us in fear of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, by taking all the courſes imaginable to provoke and exaſperate them, and upon their diſcontents (which they maliciouſly heighten and by falſhood and forgeries miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent): To graft thereupon a Pretens of a Proteſtant Plot, for a pretext to extirpate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtaniſm and introduce Popery, which they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56755:180"/> impudently pretend to be of a more firm Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the Government than the Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>I pray let it be conſidered, that that which is tolerated is put under diſgrace, even for that it is tolerated; and that which tolerates, even for that it tolerats, hath the Governing Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and in ſo much as it indulgeth, it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to modeſty and reaſon, and. if that indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhould be abuſed it may and will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. It was never intended by the Houſe of Commons, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be altered or modelled to an agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to any form or ſect of the ſeparation, or preſcrib'd to by any of the Diſſenters, or that ſhe ſhould be made ſubject to any of their rules or opinions, or her Liturgy laid aſide for directories, or which is worſe undervalued to the profane way of extemporizing: For as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed and exerciſed it deſerves no milder a ſtile. That the Church ſhould always go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by her own Wiſdom in her own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and in thoſe things that appertain to her, can never be deny'd her.</p>
            <p>No man hath reaſon to ſay, tho he hath great cauſe to diſlike the ſeparation, and to have a bad opinion of the Diſſenters, that he had rather ſubmit to Popery than to any form of the Separation, for he need do neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he pleaſeth. No man that thus expreſſeth himſelf, but will be ſuſpected to ſeek an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56755:181"/> and pretens to become a Papiſt, and to make a defection from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if theſe Gentlemen have ſuch a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt Schiſm and Separation (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is the worſt diſeaſe any Church can la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor under, and at this time threatens the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as well of the Proteſtant Religion it ſelf, as it doth to the Profeſſors of all denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations) let this ſharpen their zeal againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery (which by its unhallowed arts hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned and exaſperated our Schiſm,) and put them upon the uſe of all means to reconcile if poſſible the Schiſm (that the Papiſts have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made, and by all means endeavor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue) and take away if poſſible the occaſion of it for the time to come: And thus defeat the Arts of the Prieſts and Jeſuits for ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Church. It is a moſt deplorable thing that our Church ſhould be kept, rent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, in danger of being loſt between Ritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſcrupuloſity.</p>
            <p>Though the Scruples of the Nonconformiſts, which I always thought, and do ſtill think groundleſs, and unreaſonable, have often mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me into ſome paſſion againſt them, yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſideration, I think this their Scrupuloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be of God, and that ſome Men are by him framed to it. That he hath provided it, as a bare and obſtacle in the Natures and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of ſome devout Men, againſt any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations whatſoever, that dangerous ones
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56755:181"/> may not ſteal upon the Church, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maintaining the ſimplicity and purity of the Chriſtian Religion and Worſhip. But in ſaying this, I have ſaid nothing, that is apt to give them a conceit of themſelves, but rather to humble them: For the beſt Men are not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by their Temper and Conſtitution, but correct them by their reaſon, and determine themſelves by a clear and firm Judgement. What affrightment all this while either to Church or State, from this weak and pittyable Scrupuloſity: Where lyes the Treaſon or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, nay or ſo much as contumacy againſt our Eccleſiaſtical Governors which is ſo much upbraided to them?</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Religion may be prejudiced by addition to, as well as ſubſtraction from her rule: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by her additions hath almoſt evacuated the Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>Beſides there may be a fineneſs in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mode of religious Worſhip in its ſelf very juſtifiable, which may be not congenial to men of a courſe make. The Worſhip of God will always ſavor of the manners of the People; Men of dull capacity can ſcarce admit of any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monys without danger of falling into ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or being vext with endleſs and incurable ſcruple, until for eaſe of their minds they throw them off.</p>
            <p>But the wiſdom of the beſt Law-makers hath conſidered in giving Laws, what the People
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56755:182"/> would bare, and not what is beſt to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and many things have been tolerated by them, which they did not approve, <hi>ne majoribus mal is detur occaſio aut etiam ne vileſcant ſine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus leges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing more expoſeth the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Government to contempt, then a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and an open neglect of its Injunctions. But where obedience to Laws is exacted under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalties, where it doth not greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the common good to have them obſerved, that Government is unequal and uſeth its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority unjuſtifiable, <hi>Leges cupiunt ut jure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The conſideration of the ſad effects the Schiſm in our Church hath occaſioned, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that it hath brought upon our Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Governors. That Religion it ſelf is thereby made the ſcorn of Atheiſts. That the Papiſts are thereby furniſhed with matter of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, reproach and ſcandal to the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That every Age ſince it begun hath heightned the malignity of the Schiſm, that it ſeems now to deſpiſe the Cure of the greateſt <hi>Caſsanders.</hi> Theſe conſiderations make it infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely deſirable to have it utterly extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>There ſeems to be now left but one way of accommodating our Diviſions, and that is, that we do not hereafter make thoſe things wherein we differ matter and reaſon of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56755:182"/>
            <p>That the Children of the Light and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, be at length as wiſe in this matter as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is at unity with itſelf under more and greater differences, then thoſe that have troubled the peace of our Church; which is ſufficiently known to all Learned men.</p>
            <p>Had it not been happy, that this Schiſm had been prevented by the uſe of the power of the Church in Eccleſiaſtical diſpenſations. (If no Law had been made touching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that gave the firſt occaſion to the Schiſm, it had been in the Power of the Church to have prevented it.) No good Biſhop but would have relaxed the Canons that enjoyned theſe Ceremonies, about whoſe lawfulneſs there hath been ſo much Zeal miſpent; and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable heat and contention raiſed, for the ſake of peace and preſervation of the Unity of the Church, to men peaceable and otherwiſe obedient to her injunctions. So dangerous it is to make Laws in matters of Religion which takes the conduct of Religion, in ſo much from the guides of the Church.</p>
            <p>The beginning of contention is like the breaking out of waters, ſaith the wiſe man, and they are aſſoon as begun more eaſily end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Before the Contenders have exaſperated one another with mutual ſeverities and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies, which at every Return encreaſe, until both ſides looſe either their virtue or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of it.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:56755:183"/>
            <p>Can any man imagine that any prejudice can accrew to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if ſhe did enlarge her Communion by making the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it more eaſie, eſpecially if this may be done without annulling any of her inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the better inſtructed Chriſtians will always and the Weak may in time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly obſerve. But till they can they may be received and retained of her Communion, and not be rejected by her cenſures, tho they do not ſubmit to all of them at preſent: Will it be any prejudice, that the Number of her Biſhops be encreaſed, and that ſuffragans be appointed or approved by the preſent Biſhops, <hi>in partem ſollicitudinis,</hi> as was enacted by the ſtatute 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 14. Which Law was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by 1. 2. <hi>P. M.</hi> and revived by 8. <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 1. Theſe ſuffragans were not intended to participate of their honors or Revenues. Had it not been much more eligible to have diſpenſed with invincible ſcruples, rather than a ſchiſm ſhould have been occaſioned, which the longer if continues will be more incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and with greater difficulty accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as it grows likewiſe more miſchievous. <hi>Is it fit that the peace ſhould be hazarded, or the Nation put with reaſon or without reaſon in fear of it: Or a Kingdom turned into a Shambles for a Ceremony, or a Ritual in our publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which if omitted would leave the exerciſe of it ſolemn and decent.</hi> For no man knows
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56755:183"/> the obſtinacy of inveterate prejudices, founded perhaps in the very complexions and Natures of the diſſenters, hardned alſo in their way by obſerving, how little effect Laws have had for reducing their Numbers, and alſo how unpra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable any ſeverity is in the preſent broken and diſtracted ſtate of the Nation. Why may not ſtanding at the <hi>Sacrament</hi> be tolerated (tho kneeling is the devouteſt geſture, and to me moſt agreeable) when it is a poſture of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er enjoyned in the Primitive Church, in their ſolemn meetings for Divine Worſhip, between the Feaſts of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide.</hi> Why may not the ſigning of the Croſs in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> for the ſake of peace and unity be diſpenſed with, where deſired when the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is intire without it? Why may not our publick <hi>Liturgy</hi> be changed and altered, tho it may be defended as it is, and as it is entertains the devotions of the beſt men, meerly for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe it is not liked in ſome parts of it by ſome men, yet truly devout? Beſides it is the wiſh of ſome excellent perſons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that our publick offices were more and thoſe we have, not ſo long, and that the Church had a greater Treaſury of Prayers, and by variety of Forms for the ſame Office were enlarged in her ſpirit of Prayer, and her publick Devotions heightned. Why may not the <hi>Rubrick</hi> be altered as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſcruples ſhall ariſe, by the Authority of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56755:184"/> the Church, which would not leſſen her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but advance the eſteem of her Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the exerciſe of it, when ſhe uſeth it for edification?</p>
            <p>It is much better ſure to give place to an innocent opinion, when entertained by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Numbers, tho a miſtake then to keep up contention and ſtrife. Peace in the Church is better than preciſe and nice orthodoxneſs, and Union is to be preferred before unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth, which is of no more importance to our ſalvation, then one of <hi>Euclids</hi> propoſitions, tho to be ſure not ſo certain and of leſs uſe.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of the Church is not to make men great Clerks, to improve us to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Schools, but to build men up in the Faith and Love of God, by which they may be inſtructed to every good Work. Her aim is not to make men courtly in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior in our Churches, but truly devout, and true devotion will never fail to make the Publick Worſhip ſolemn, and advance it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a decent formality.</p>
            <p>But I would not be miſtaken, it is not the Diſſenters I intend to befriend, but the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for as for them I declare I have no liking to any thing they ſay or do, and am eſpecially diſſatisfyed with their very bad man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It is difficult to abſtain from an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, but that I think it would be thrown away upon them, and that they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56755:184"/> incorrigible. This is not the ſeaſon for inſtructing their Wiſdoms, we muſt wait for the <hi>mollia tempora fondi.</hi> I thus conclude ſince that excellent perſon the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> hath been treated by them, with ſuch petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancies and rude inſults for his Sermon of the miſchiefs of ſeparation. If a diſcourſe mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with almoſt irreſiſtible reaſon, candor, temper and Addreſs be matter of exaſperation, and they turn again and are more hardned in their obſtinacies, and become more confirmed in their ſeparating way, nothing but their own thoughts, and the conſideration in what a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate condition, they have brought the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion by their Separation will reclaim them.</p>
            <p>But it is expected that Governments ſhould be wiſe, that they manage and controul the Follies and Weakneſſes of thoſe committed to their care, that they may do the leaſt miſchief to themſelves and others, and by prudent and practicable methods amend and reform them. The moſt froward weiward and ſtubborn Children give their Parents the moſt care, and opportunities of exerciſing the moſt tender love for them, tho they can take no complacency in their awkerdneſs. The Church of <hi>England</hi> is concerned to retain all her Children in her Family to ſhut out none by abdication, that their numbers be not few, and ſhe be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when ſhe ſpeaks with her Enemy in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56755:185"/> Gate. Not to provoke any of them to wrath, leaſt they forſake her and turn againſt her when diſtreſſes ſhall come upon her. She hath reaſon at this time ſure to make her Diſcipline eaſie, and to learn of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be more comprehenſive. Their Doctrin of comprehenſion is ſo large, that it deſtroys the Religion to encreaſe the Number of Profeſſors, but I mean no more, than that poſitive and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable inſtitutions may give place to the peace, ſecurity, and preſervation of Religion it ſelf, to whoſe ſervice they were firſt fram'd and deſign'd.</p>
            <p>It hath been heretofore, of old it hath been ſaid <hi>Mores Leges in poteſtatem pertraxerunt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. Plato</hi> form'd an <hi>Idea</hi> to himſelf of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth, without reſpect to the manners of men, but he writ another, which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Origen</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Celſus</hi> applyes to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Anſwer of a famous Law-giver, who asked <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the Anſwer was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And we all know what God permitted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the matter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce for the hardneſs of their Hearts. When all is ſaid People muſt be govern'd as they can.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time, it is pity any of our zeal and indignation ſhould be miſpent, when we have uſe for it all againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſource whence all our diviſions ſpring. To which we owe the firſt ſeparations, that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56755:185"/> were made in our Chutch, which appears by undenyable Records, publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> in his Book, called the <hi>Unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Separation.</hi> How they have propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, multiplyed, exaſperated, and promoted our diviſions, to tell you would make a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, beſides no Proteſtant is now to know it. I have only this further to obſerve, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at firſt only deſign'd by the Arts of dividing us, and breaking us into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Communions, to diſgrace the Reformation, to make our Spiritual Governors Paſtors and Teachers, loſe their Authority with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. To deprave our Religion with licentious opiniaſtre and abſurd dogmatizing, to load our departure from that Church, with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of innumerable Schiſmes, and to make us reconcileable to the Tyranny and impoſtures of that Church, from the vain opinions and licentiouſneſs of the Sectaries, who have been ſeduced, managed, inflamed and made wild by their impoſturous Arts and Deceits.</p>
            <p>This I believe was only at firſt deſigned by the Prieſts, but now they apparently deſign by the Diſſenters to deſtroy the Church, or by the Church to deſtroy the Diſſenters, that they more eaſily come to rights with her. They imagine the Diſſenters are very numerous, and that the Nation is fallen into two great parts, that the Diſſenters numbers are vaſt. But God be thanked they neither make our grand Jury
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56755:186"/> men, nor the common Halls of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> for chooſing the Lord Majors or Sheriffs. And I challeng any man to give me a Liſt of all the Names of Diſſenters, that were of the Houſe of Commons in our two laſt Parliaments, I am ſure they will not make an Number, but they reckon the Numbers of Diſſenters by the care they have taken to encreaſe it. They uſed great art to continue the Separation when His Majeſty was reſtored: Since Laws have been made to raiſe the Animoſities of Diſſenters, but ſcarce ever executed for repreſſing them. If for any reaſon of ſtate the Laws here and there, and for a ſpurt have been exacted, ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and ſupports have been given to their Preachers of greateſt Authority with them. And when they have ſeem'd to preach with the courage and zeal of confeſſors to their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they have been aſſured not only of indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but have received rewards. How proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly did the work of ſeparation go on by theſe Councils of our <hi>Achtlophels,</hi> by theſe means they concluded it would be heightned, that it would admit of no terms of an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How inſolent were their Harangues more taking with their deluded Auditors, while they apprehended them, acted with an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible zeal of Religion. What Animations did their People receive to defy the Church and her Authority, when their Preachers deſpiſed Fines
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56755:186"/> and Impriſonment to their ſeeming out of pure zeal againſt her Order.</p>
            <p>It is well known ſeveral of them were in Penſion, and no men have been better received by the D. than <hi>J. J. J. O. E. B.</hi> and <hi>W. P. &amp;c.</hi> Ringleaders of the Separation: Beſides that Popiſh Prieſts have been taken and executed for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Field meetings in <hi>Scotland.</hi> They have raiſed there a ſort of <hi>Euthuſiaſts</hi> more wild and miſchievous, than any we had amongſt us in the times of licentiouſneſs. They have had notwithſtanding great Lords that have patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſ'd them who were always well received in their applications in their favor, at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and ſeveral of their Preachers who were not Prieſts, have received exhibitions and penſions for their Encouragement. It was neceſſary that the Fanaticiſm planted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould be very loathſome to make that Nation abate any of their zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, or to neglect their fears and apprehenſions of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, or to make the leaſt ſtep towards it.</p>
            <p>Awake you drowſie Sleepers, open your Eyes? the Sun is riſen, there is light enough to fill your ſight, if you would look up and were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee. Could any thing be conceiv'd more apt, to bring the Church of <hi>England</hi> into contempt and ſcorn with thoſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration then to have Laws made in her favor, penal Laws which are thought to be of her procurement, and not executed. Vain
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56755:187"/> and Ineffective anger is always returned with contumely, ſcorn and hatred. <hi>Cupide conculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur nimis ante metitum.</hi> And ſo it hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in this caſe, nothing hath been more paſſable than the baſeſt Scurrility upon the Church, the Biſhops and the Clergy. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, the impious and profane have liſted themſelves Fanaticks, that they might have the greater Liberty of reviling Religion it ſelf with impunity, Conſider how the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is uſed, which is truly the Bulwark of the Proteſtant Religion. About ten years ſince they deſigned to ſlight her works, and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh her by a general indulgence and toleration. And now they intend to deſtroy her Garriſon, thoſe that can, and will defend her againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. By one of their Pamphleteers, the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is called an uſurpation upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all the Diſſenters (as ſuch only) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Traitors to the King. The ſame Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would perſwade the World, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to extirpate Popery is by rooting out of Fanaticiſm, whither (ſaith he) the Fanaticks bring on the Jeſuits plot, or the Jeſuits the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks is not a farthing matter. But in the mean time, that the Papiſts have a plot on foot needs no proof: That any ſort of Proteſtants are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a plot cannot be proved. But all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> think it more righteous to puniſh the Deceivers, and pitty the Deceived, and wiſh them only cut off,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56755:187"/> that make diviſions. It is one way of curing or rather of extinguiſhing the diſeaſe to Kill the Patient. But no Prince did ever yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Cut-Throats for his People, in epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſeaſes inſtead of Phyſitians. But if the Papiſts could arm other Proteſtants againſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, there would be the leſs work for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to do. And they will be ſure to requite them, for this favor with <hi>Polyphemus</hi> his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie. For to give the Devil his due, they are not themſelves ſo fond of Maſſacres and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Hereticks, as to envy that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to any other, that will undertake it. They had rather any other party of Men ſhould do the Drudgery for them. Beſides what one ſort of Proteſtants ſhall execute upon another, will give them better pretence and more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs (if they wanted either Pretence or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to deſtroy ſuch as they call Hereticks) to execute the like deſtruction upon the Church Proteſtants, who certainly differ more from the Papiſts then the Separatiſts do from our Church. Sure there is good Reaſon they ſhould be more ſharply treated by the Papiſts, than they treated the Diſſenters. And if they are in ſuch ſort us'd they muſt lay their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their mouths; and be ſilent before their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, and acknowledg the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, in bringing ſuch tribulation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, from their Enemies wherewith they troubled their own Brethren.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56755:188"/>
            <p>But there are better ways of putting an end to the Popiſh Plot, then by putting it in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for them. (That is to ſay) by ſuppreſſing that contumacy, that is grown ſo rife in the Diſſenters againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by putting the Revilers of her Eſtabliſhment and Order under the ſevereſt Penalties.</p>
            <p>By the Church her condeſcentions and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to thoſe that are weak and ſcrupulous, &amp; the peaceable Diſſenters, ſuch condeſcentions will not abate but magnifie her Authority. The Church of <hi>England</hi> will not be by this means loſt, but her Governance preſerved, eſpecially if the Relaxation that ſhall be made proceeds from her <hi>ex mero motu,</hi> and is not impoſed upon her by any ſecular Authority. Nay ſhe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by this means more ample and venerable. What Glories will ſhine upon the Heads of the Biſhops: We ſhall all riſe up &amp; call them bleſſed. They will attain an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here, and receive divine Honors while they live. Their Order will be recover'd into the higheſt Veneration, and it will never be after a queſtion in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Church whither the Order of Biſhops be Apoſtolical. The Parliament will make all Laws yield and comply to ſuch happy peaceable and gratious Intendments. All the People will honor them as their common Saviors, that ſhall thus ſnatch us from the very Brink of Ruine, and render the Deſigns of the implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church ready to take effect to the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56755:188"/> deſtruction of our Religion, and the Nation, utterly defeated.</p>
            <p>But what puniſhments can we think too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere upon any, that ſhall be guilty of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Iniquity, as not to allow, that liberty to the Church which they ſeek as a favor from her to themſelves, that will not let the Church eſcape their Cenſures, when ſhe gratiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts them from her Cenſures, and pittys their Errors and Follies. What Fines and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments, Pillories and Scourgings do they deſerve, that perſecute the Church with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings, when they themſelves are tolerated. Their condemnation muſt be juſt, what ever their doom be, themſelves being Juges: They will ſuffer as Evil doers and diſturbers of the peace, not for their Religion, but for a moſt extravagant and intolerable unrighteouſneſs. They who will not tolerate others are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for that reaſon moſt intolerable. Againſt theſe our Laws are to be ſharpen'd, and their iniquities to be puniſhed by a Judge. But the Statute of 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which puniſheth diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and peaceable withdrawings from the publick worſhip with exile, and death declares how odly the buſineſs of the Separation hath been managed, and with what diſadvantages to the Church; as it doth alſo the impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cableneſs of Laws, that make perhaps invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible prejudices, and modeſt and peaceable diſſatisfactions capitally criminal. The execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56755:189"/> of this Law is ſcarce poſſible. It is by no means agreeable, either to the Chriſtian temper of our Church, or His Majeſties great Clemency of which he hath aſſured us in the general courſe of his Reign. And eſpecially for that that Law hath been very rarely proceeded upon. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that lay in <hi>Cambridge</hi> Goal; under the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Law was reprieved by His Majeſty, with a great diſlike expreſſed by him againſt that and ſuch like ſeverities. What ever extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances of a few wild Fanaticks of that Age oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd that Law: the State of the Separation and of the Nation being quite alter'd from what it was then; the execution of this Law now, would be ſomething like a Sheriffs ſerving a Writ out of Date, in another County which can have no effect but miſchief to himſelf.</p>
            <p>While our Diſſenters are thus reaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, and ſtrictly obliged to their peaceable behavior, they can give no apprehenſions to the Government either in Church or State. This is all that is deſigned, and all that they ought to have, and this certainly would be readily yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in this preſent juncture, eſpecially if the Evils of the late unhappy times did not ſtand upon their ſcore.</p>
            <p>But I perſwade my ſelf, that this courſe if it had been heretofore taken would have prevented one great cauſe of our late Troubles, ſo it will in ſuch meaſure prevent them from returning, as the ſeparation can be accounted the cauſe of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56755:189"/> them. As for the Sacriledge and Spoil, which was then made upon our Church it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have happen'd, but upon the diſſolution of the Government, nor can it ever happen again.</p>
            <p>That War would have been impoſſible, if the Church-men had not maintained the doctrine, that Monarchy was <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe that made the King abſolute, and they and the Church in conſequence periſhed by it.</p>
            <p>But God be thanked, we ſee the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain reſtored to her endowments, grown wiſer than to deſire to hold that precariouſly, and at pleaſure, ſhe doth enjoy by an unmovable legal Right. Of the three Eſtates of this Kingdom (for to ſuſpect any ſuch thing of the King would be unpardonable blaſphemy) there can be no reaſonable Suſpition. Though of the Houſe of Commons it is be come now lawful to ſuſpect and ſay any thing, that is evil. But no man but the Villains, that deſign by diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring them, to change the Government hath reaſon to entertain ſuch a thought. The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Commons in our lateſt Parliaments, were all upon the matter entirely conformable to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> They were perſons of the beſt Eſtates, Reputation and Honor in their Countries: And they, or ſuch as they are like to make our ſucceeding Parliaments.</p>
            <p>I have leave to put them under the impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſevereſt Curſe, if ever they do ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56755:190"/> impair the Church her Revenues. And I deſire it may be aſſiſted with the hearty and paſſionate deſires of all good Chriſtians, that ſo the curſe I now pronounce may operate upon them who ſhall incur it. He that deſigns, contrives or conſents to ſpoil the Church, of any of her Endowments; may a ſecret curſe waſt his ſubſtance. Let his Children be Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds and beg their bread in deſolate places. Beſides I know it is meditated, and deſign'd by many, and the beſt Men, that uſe to be ſent to Parliaments, to redeem in part, that infamous Sacriledge, that was committed in the times of <hi>H.</hi> 8. When the Appropriations of Rectories made to religious Houſes which had the cure of the Pariſh, and ought at the diſſolution of the Monaſteries to be preſented to, were veſted in the Crown whereby not only the Church was rob'd, but the People cheated of their Tythes which were theirs to give, tho not to retain, and their <hi>praemium</hi> for the Prieſts Miniſtrations; which are now often moſt ſlenderly and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſcandalouſly performed. As alſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encumber her Revenue of the Charges and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Firſt-fruits and Tythes, which were impoſed and exacted by the Pope, upon his pretence of being the oecumenical Paſtor and High Prieſt of the Chriſtian Church, and at that time confer'd upon the Crown, and are as unreaſonably continued, as any thing can be that hath a Law for a pretext. But for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56755:190"/> this a compenſation may be given to the Crown, and ſome way will be found out for Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vicaridges and reindowment of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that loſt all in that unparrallel'd Sacriledge, committed by the unſatiable Avarice of that haughty and luxurious Prince. Theſe deſigns employ the care of a great Number of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal gentlemen, to purge the ſin and diſhonor brought upon the Nation by that extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry King.</p>
            <p>But if there were reaſon for any fear, that the Nation could again incur the guilt of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge. What Warranty can this give to any of her Clergy to ſlack or abate the Zeal, that is due for the purity of her Doctrine, prudence of her diſcipline, and her commendable decent and intelligible devotion. Are they worthy to be named of her, that are ready to diſſert her out of fear of a remote poſſibility, that ſhe may not always have ſuch largeſſes, as ſhe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon her Sons? Will they prefer the gift to the Altar, and declare all their godlineſs to be gain? To ſuffer Popery for ſuch a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be induc'd upon her, is a far worſe and more deteſtable ſacriledge than that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to fear. This is to make the <hi>Anathemata</hi> of the Temple to inſerve to the diſhonor of the <hi>Numen.</hi> To deſecrate the Altar for the ſake of the gift, and will by the juſt judgment of God (I fear) bring the abomination of deſolation again into our holy places.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56755:191"/>
            <p>Let none of her Sons for the obtaining a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or a capacity for a double benefice betray her by neglecting her intereſt, thinking with themſelves that ſhe will otherwiſe be ſupported, for this their doings is no leſs than the ſin of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> who took money to betray our Lord, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, that he would by a Miracle reſcue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the hands of thoſe to whom he ſold and betray'd him.</p>
            <p>The honeſt of our Clergy will have little ſatisfaction, when that day comes, when they ſhall be reduc'd to Prayers and Tears, if they are failing in any thing, that they may lawfully do to prevent that miſerable State. Their Tears will be as water ſpilt upon the ground, and their Prayers wiil never find acceptance with God, nor be returned into their own boſom.</p>

            <p>But above all thoſe fine men are not to paſs unreproved, who are preparing Pretences for their Revolt to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. They tell us that the Reformation is depraved, and Popery it ſelf is much amended ſince the Reformation, that it is not ſo groſly ſuperſtitious (tho her ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions are ſtill enough to ſtifle Religion) nor ſo fabulous in her Legends (ſhe need make no new ones ſince ſhe gives Authority ſtill to the old) nor ſo impoſterous in her cheats (for her Prieſts have not been <hi>hocus pocuſes</hi> of late us'd
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56755:191"/> ſo many tricks of Legerdemain, and preſented their puppey plays of moving &amp; ſqueaking ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) ſince the Reformation as before.</p>
            <p>But they may know, that the reaſon why we have not maintained the dignity of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation intire is this, for that Popery hath not been utterly extirpated from amongſt us tho their frequent Treaſons, and their notorious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductious have deſerved it. By its continuance amongſt us, and the reſorts of their Prieſts hither, it hath created and fomented diviſions amongſt us, and corrupted her Children from their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to her guidance and inſtructions, but ſhe her ſelf is ſtill the ſame ſhe was, the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church is ſtill intire. She hath made good her departure from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> her Adverſaries have not been able to convict her of any fault therein, and by an eaſie victory ſhe hath triumphed over all their oppoſitions.</p>
            <p>And tho Popery appear not altogether ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by her Prieſts Artificial dreſs, and the Repreſentations they make of her to ſeduce us, and entice us to come again under her yoke, yet we know ſhe hath more eſtabliſhed her Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted her Morals by her modern Caſuiſts ſince the Reformation, and thereby hath rendred her ſelf more deteſtable, and for ever to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. But though it may be true, that the Popiſh world is beholden to the Reformation, and Popery it ſelf is thereby amended in ſome
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56755:192"/> overt things, and reformed in thoſe Countries, that have not reformed from her. For in the Light of the Reformation they have ſeen Light, and have been aſhamed of ſome of their works of darkneſs, &amp; do not bring into preſent uſe ſome of their groſs Impoſtures, and ſome worſe than Pagan ſuperſtitions. Yet when this Light is extinguiſhed it will be a moſt diſmal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Night upon the Chriſtian world. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to her our Ears will be bor'd, and we ſhall be irredeemably enſlaved.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of Popery if it returns and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us again, that hath been walking in the reformed Countries as in dry places ſeeking Reſt and finding none, and finds us thus ſwept and garniſhed, will bring with it ſeven Devils more wicked than it ſelf, and our laſt eſtate will be worſe than the firſt.</p>
            <p>The Pride, Cruelty and Avarice, Dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Luxury of their Prieſt-hood, will be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated upon us, and the minds of the Laity, more lowly depreſſed by ſuperſtition and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The Goſpel of Cardinal <hi>Palavicini</hi> will be the Canon of the Chriſtian Religion or it may be ſomething worſe; for who can tell what will be the Religion, that that Church will offer in proceſs of time, to the World under the Chriſtian Name. When the Pope by his pretended infallibility, may make the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion what he pleaſe, by interpreting, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, altering or detracting with an uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56755:192"/> Authority. For us therefore to become Papiſts to return to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Popes infallibility (there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to become Papiſts) is virtually to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the Chriſtian Faith to renounce our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to our Lord Chriſt, to prefer the Bulls of a Prophane Pope, to the Holy Oracles of God, and the Revelation of Jeſus, God Bleſſed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>With this Religion therefore we can never make an accommodation. We may as well make a Covenant with Hell. This (as Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> one of the glories of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in his Book call'd the <hi>Eternal Truth of Scriptures,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently admoniſheth us) admits no terms of Parly for any poſſible Reconcilement, whoſe following words to this purpoſe, I ſhall here tranſcribe.</p>

               <p>Now I have given you my Anſwer to your Reaſons, to diſſwade me from publiſhing the Argument for the Biſhops; by repreſenting how few of the Clergy can with Reaſon be thought guilty of Opinions, ſo miſchievous to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56755:193"/> the Church and State, which you charge to have generally corrupted them, and how eaſily and with little conſideration they will be laid aſide by them.</p>
               <p>I will make no other Apology for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this, than that I have communicated theſe thoughts to no Man alive, either of the Church of <hi>England</hi> or any other Demominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or conſulted any Mans advice about it. That I can ſerve the deſign of no party of men herein, nor any particular deſign of my own. I wiſh, they can be ſerviceable in the leaſt Degree to publick Good. I have had them by me a great while, and have conſider'd them under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Varieties of Temper, that our Bodies are diſpoſed to, which induce different thoughts, and various Apprehenſions in moſt things, under the ſeveral paſſions, that the fluctuation of publick Affairs have occaſioned; under the Ebs and Flows of Hopes and Fears in reference to the ſtate of the Kingdom, for ſome length of time.
